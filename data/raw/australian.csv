"Private health ins for kids with autism? I’m doing a bit of legwork on behalf of a friend with limited English. Long story short he has a 3 year old son who is likely to be diagnosed with fairly severe autism (once he can get in to see a specialist). I understand most preexisting conditions require a 12 month waiting period and thats fine, but I’m having trouble identifying policies that cover things like speech therapy and other development related Family has a fair number of other ongoing medical issues, so good private coverage is probably best in any event (even though they are well below the levy threshold) as public appointments are rare as hen’s teeth where we are. Does anyone have experience and have recommendations for solid private coverage, with an emphasis on the aspects mentioned above? Thank you! Edit: i should mention that he’s also pursuing ndis as well, but what a fucking labyrinth that is. It’s hard to keep everything straight as he’s been sent to so many places but the latest word is that the only places he can get in to get ndis diagnosis in a relatively short period of time are gojng to be private. He will do what he must to pay for it in the short term, but as his son will likely require long term treatment, i was thinking private insurance might—in this instance—pay off. He does have centrelink cards, etc. If that changes anything. EDIT EDIT: dear all, thank you SO MUCH for the advice and insight. I really appreciate it. I will be meeting my friend tomorrow and will be making some phone calls. We’ve been in touch with so many different people and they keep saying we need a diagnosis before they can act, so this has been very, very helpful. Negative knowledge (i.e., private health insurance is not a good option for this) is also very useful. Let’s me focus on more productive avenues. Thanks again, i’m quite moved by all the helpful info. Edit edit edit: ok I’ve received some more emails from my friend. Someone from EACH came to his house last week and sent a followup email. They said: **”If you are worried about [son] being on the autism spectrum you can have him assessed by a Paediatrician. You can be referred to a paediatrician by your GP and there is the public paediatricians but the wait time to see them is quite long or you are able to go privately but there is a cost you will have to pay for this. “** Also: **”Here are 2 speech therapists that have said they have possible space to take on new children, they are private so there will be a cost involved”** So i’m confused. What does EACH do besides send us to private practices with no financial support? i’ll call tomorrow for clarification, but for the most part their advice has simply been to go pay a paediatrician and go pay for speech therapy. I mean, yeah, ok, but is that really the extent of their assistance? Oh and they had some basic advice on how to encourage him to speak (he’s nonverbal) and sent a link to a playgroup website…. The support is underwhelming, especially when they know the family has limited English and limited literacy…",Australian,reddit/Australia,3074

As you will see on google maps, new houses are enormous compared to older generation houses, so I was curious as to what people are doing with all the additional space? Average household size of 4.5 people in 1911 has dropped to 2.5 in 2024. Houses in the 1950's were 100 square metres, and are now 230+ square metres. Even looking at homes from the 1970s and 80s, they have such a smaller footprint, but they don't feel small. They were a big step up from the 50s and usually had two lounge rooms.

"Why are hospitality venue owners so stubborn/small/backwards/stuck in the past thinking? I recently completed a 3 night trial at a venue in a capital city. During the interview I was told · the venue was 4 stories high (3 active floors and a basement used for private functions, weeknights and spillover) · That ownership has 4 venues · It’s a party (owners favourite word) venue · The management structure is venue manager, assistant venue manager, supervisors (up to 4) · Management (all levels) should be on the floor as much as possible and rarely in the office · Ownership has been collecting data on patronage, volume of sales, volume of drinks per patron etc and developed KPIs to match for each night · A whiskey bar with over 30 whiskeys and other spirits (advertised on website) When in reality · The venue is currently only operating the basement room (which is a dark, dingy, dungeon like space without any of the cool dungeon appeal) · Its actually 2 venues · The atmosphere does not lend itself to ‘party’ · There is no assistant venue manager, just VM and the sole supervisor role I am doing a trial for · The VM spends half of the night in the office uploading data into the system for ownership to keep track of – including how many promo cards are handing out on the street vs handed in at the door for discounted entry (which is fine) – but to be physically uploaded as data into the system every hour · The KPIs are measured down the person per hour as expectations (in attendance and then spending volume) – the VM seemed under immense stress to hit ‘targets/projections’ (not enough people coming through the door was apparently the fault of the promo people in the street, once inside not enough spend per patron was management and bars fault) · Bar staff are encouraged to try upsell patrons drink order towards a more expensive drink (I believe you do that maybe once on their first drink, but as a bartender you get what someone wants, you do not tell them what they want) – also to move patrons on from beer to spirits as soon as possible as the profit margin is higher and also alcohol to get them to spend more money · Was told point blank by manager of other venue while discussing ideas to improve business that ‘you keep them to yourself for at least 6 months, ownership doesn’t want to hear it’ · Whiskey bar is part of the venue not being used – but none of the drinks made their way down to the 1 bar still in use · There is no active social media · And the bit that got me undone – health and safety out the window – I had to mop up a scene after a guy in a wheelchair was forced to urinate on the floor in the space before the toilets because there was no ramp to allow wheelchair access over the 3 stairs (heritage listed buildings don’t have to comply with disability access, but no access to toilets is a step to far for me that is discrimination) – but no wet floor signs, no gloves the next night for a staff member to clean up spew in a basin, no rubber mats on the floor behind the bar, rips in the carpet that catch shoes and the feet of barstools, steps that are unlit and trip hazards) and staff and patrons openly vaping in the venue despite it being completely against the law - and me being the arsehole for telling people to stop it. At the end of the trial (so around 4am on the Sunday morning) I was offered the supervisor role by the VM but expressed concerns regarding the operations of the business and particularly the lack of health and safety practices, and said I had to think about it, but would be likely back as I feel I can make a difference. I received a phone call around 6pm that Sunday night telling me I was not required as there were ‘other trials’ being conducted. I texted the General Manager (who had been my contact) asking if matter could be discussed, the reply was ‘You are not the right fit’ and they are currently readvertising. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first venue I have been at where ownership seems to only care about their own profit regardless of anything else (and if business isn’t doing well then cut corners and blame staff) and their own ego (and definitely not being challenged). I might be a bit old school – but I believe that profits will come if you earn them – ie, good product, good service, happy customers, good advertising (which is basically free in a social media age, if you do it), reputations (this venues one is down the drain I was told on the street) and the ability to keep staff instead of advertising constantly. It shouldn't feel like an episode of Kitchen Nightmares with Gordon Ramsay where everyone, but the owner knows what is wrong with the business and generally agrees how to improve it (and wants too), but ownership refuses to change and just blames the staff and customers. But, I guess that is why I am not an owner.. or in this case a supervisor any more either - have a feeling I am not the only hospo worker in the same situation",Australian,reddit/Australia,4960

I am now certain that the Australian Financial Complaints Authority is used by insurance companies to terrify their staff. “If you don’t behave, the AFCA will come and eat you.” They went from, “We will look at your complaint in 30 days…” to a personalised phone call, financial compensation and immediate action on all the points of my complaint within 24 hours of my complaint to the AFCA being sent to them.
