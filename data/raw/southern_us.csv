"Anti-First Amendment Bill on the floor today? I’m seeing that , the bill by Senator Creighton and Rep. Leach, is up on the House floor today. As a Christian and someone really involved in my campus church, I’m honestly concerned about what this means for religious freedom. Our ministry brings pastors and faith leaders to campus to speak in the free speech zones. It’s a big part of how we share the Gospel and build community. From what I’m reading, this bill would make that a lot harder maybe even impossible. It also bans expressive activity between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. So does that mean no more Midnight Yell at A&M? That’s a Texas tradition. And what about tailgates? We use tents, we play music, we gather in those same spaces. The language in this bill is so broad, it sounds like that could be at risk too. It just doesn’t sit right with me. Whether you’re a person of faith, political, not political, or just a sports fan, I really think folks should reach out to their rep and ask them to vote no on SB 2972. And apparently there wasn’t even a public hearing in the House? If we’re serious about free speech, then the people should get to speak too.",Southern US,reddit/Texas,1160

Many of us work part time at some form of IV hydration business to make ends meet, as working on an ambulance or hospital is draining on our mental health.

If we are trusted to respond to an emergency and provide life saving treatments, why are we being excluded from providing basic IV hydration in a controlled clinical setting?

"From Lubbock to Houston: A Texan’s Defense of the Global University I was born and educated in Texas. I studied in Lubbock, I live in College Station, and I receive neurological care at UTHealth in Houston. That triangle alone—Texas Tech, Texas A&M, and UTHealth—represents thousands of international students, scholars, and doctors who didn’t just choose to come here. They \*were invited.\* Now the federal government is aiming political weapons at them. And they’re pretending it won’t hit the rest of us. They’re wrong. Recently, the Department of Homeland Security launched a direct assault on Harvard University’s ability to enroll international students. It’s a stunt. A pellet gun aimed at a buck so big it won’t fall—but loud enough to scatter the herd. And make no mistake: I \*am\* in that herd. Because when you fire at Harvard, you don’t just target the Ivy League. You spook the institutions that hold Texas together. You disrupt our universities, our clinics, our labs, and our futures. *The Doctor Who Keeps Me Alive* At UTHealth, my neurologist—like many others—was born overseas. He came here to learn, to teach, and to treat patients like me. My ability to write this right now is partially thanks to the very kind of visa-holder that DHS is quietly threatening. You think these policies just affect elite students in Cambridge? They affect my seizure care in Houston. They affect the research being done in Lubbock. They affect who teaches your niece chemical engineering in College Station. You don’t get to separate Harvard from Texas when international education is the \*bridge\* between them. *Texas Tech Taught Me That Diversity Isn’t Cosmetic* When I was a student at Texas Tech, I saw firsthand the power of a diverse faculty and student body. It wasn’t political. It was \*effective.\* I learned from professors from India, Egypt, Korea, Nigeria, and Brazil. I worked on projects with students from Uzbekistan and Colombia. We didn’t sit around singing Kumbaya. We solved problems. We debated ideas. We competed and collaborated and made each other sharper. That’s the global university. Not a “woke” fantasy. A working engine. And now, the same federal officials who claim to champion innovation want to strip that engine for parts—because they don’t like what a few students believe? Because they think fear will keep us safe? *This Is About Control, Not Security* Let’s not be coy. This isn’t about national security. It’s about narrative control. It’s about telling public universities, “You can have federal funding, but only if you help us police your students.” It’s about turning faculty into informants. About chilling research. About reminding anyone with a visa that their presence is conditional—fragile, revocable, and watched. But if public universities comply with this logic, they will cease to be public in any meaningful way. They’ll become gatekeepers of obedience, not gateways to knowledge. *We Don’t Scatter. We Turn.* This is not a time to stay quiet, and it’s not a time to pretend this only affects the coasts. If Texas A&M, Texas Tech, UTHealth—and institutions like them—stand together, then the herd won’t scatter. It will \*pivot.\* And when it does, the people lighting firecrackers in D.C. will realize they were never holding a gun. They were just holding a match in a dry season. If you're reading this and thinking, “This doesn’t concern me,” think again. If you live in Texas and you’ve ever been treated in a hospital, driven through a college town, or sent a kid to a public university—then this isn’t about someone else. It’s about you. We are all downstream from the global university. We are all somewhere between Lubbock and Houston. And we deserve better than to be governed by spectacle.",Southern US,reddit/Texas,3759

"Persuade me not to flee Persuade me not to flee Texas for Minneapolis. It really sucks feeling like you're different all the time when your most ""radical"" positions are: guns are a public health issue, poor people should get healthcare regardless of job status, and pregnancy is hard on a woman's body and she shouldn't be forced to carry a fetus to term. Honestly, other than that, I'd probably be a moderate by Minnesota standards--I went to a very PC liberal arts college, and that shit made me a bit more right-wing. It just sucks living here (DFW area) because you believe in pronouncing Kamala Harris's name right, you don't think socialist sympathizers are the causes of the world's ills, you think atheists are fine people, and you don't believe dogs can prevent school shootings (real conversations I have had with people here). Obviously, Dallas voted blue, so it's not like everyone here thinks that way, but it gets very frustrating. So convince me not to flee--I'd only be making $40k a year as a medical assistant, so it's not like I could live a grand lifestyle there. Edit: Thanks for all the support (even though that's not ostensibly what I wanted? Lol)! Strangely enough (maybe because of emphasis on medical and UNIONS), wages are $2-3 an hour greater there. The reason I chose Minneapolis over, say, somewhere in the Pacific Northwest is because cost of living (or at least rent, maybe not gas & groceries) is actually lower than in DFW. The liberal arts college I went to was actually in the Midwest, so it wouldn't be a super huge culture shock.

"Why are only public schools stuck with STAAR if private and charter schools get public money too? Texas is giving taxpayer dollars to private schools through vouchers but only public schools are forced to take the STAAR test and get accountability ratings. If we’re going to talk about “school accountability,” it should apply to every school that takes public money including private, not just the public schools serving the most diverse, high-need kids. STAAR isn’t fairness it’s a double standard. It creates more cost for our public schools and when schools create educational systems for their specific classroom needs they get tanked on accountability scores. I have never seen the same accountability scores for private schools. These scores create a scenario where it seems like only public schools have deficiencies when not adhering to accountability when the other schools have NO accountability. How is this fair?

"Texas AG Ken Paxton Can Access Your Prescription Records >PDMP datasets typically include patient details, medication dosages, refill schedules, and identifying information for the prescriber and pharmacy. In nine states, the PDMP entry even contains the diagnosis code (ICD-10) associated with the prescription. That means a police officer scrutinizing the file could directly see why a person was prescribed a drug. In states like Tennessee or Florida, which track diagnoses, a record showing testosterone cypionate accompanied by an ICD code for “gender dysphoria” would immediately telegraph that the patient is transgender. >As is often the case with law enforcement surveillance tools, PDMPs have proven susceptible to mission creep, Oliva writes, noting that most state programs now track not only opioids but “all controlled substances as well as non-controlled ‘drugs of concern.’” In other words, a system built to catch illicit OxyContin refills has quietly become a mechanism to monitor any number of treatments – from anxiety medications and stimulants for the treatment of ADHD to testosterone for gender transition. >Crucially, this vast trove of prescription records exists in a legal gray zone outside standard medical privacy protections. The questions about HIPAA compliance typically come up when I've discussed this subject. However, once a pharmacy uploads your data to a PDMP, that information is no longer covered by HIPAA privacy rules. Instead, each state dictates who can access the PDMP and for what purpose. Unfortunately, law enforcement agencies have lobbied hard for access. >Today, every state allows police or prosecutors to retrieve PDMP data, often without so much as a warrant. In many jurisdictions, all it takes is an administrative request or subpoena to sift through a person’s prescription history. Some PDMPs even generate unsolicited alerts such as if the software’s algorithms deem someone’s prescribing or usage “suspicious,” it can automatically tip off law enforcement. [...] >In their quest to create a gender bureaucracy to police the lives of transgender people, the anti-trans side is on board with the creation of an Orwellian surveillance state that tracks everyone's prescriptions. >Given how much more prevalent hormone prescriptions are among the cisgender population, any attempt to police and surveil transgender people's prescriptions will inevitably catch orders of magnitude more cis people in the surveillance dragnet. But that's entirely the intention. In this situation, it's become explicitly clear that transgender people are a mere pretext to enable a mass surveillance system to gain control over everyone's bodies and what prescriptions they are able to take. Ken Paxton and his cronies can access your prescription records, even if you don't live in Texas.

"No Shelter, No Humane Officer—Dogs in Lincoln County, WV I want to bring attention to something deeply troubling happening in Lincoln County, West Virginia—a place that has no county-run animal shelter and no humane officer. That means when dogs are neglected, abused, or abandoned, there’s no official system to help them. Instead, a few small nonprofit rescues—run by caring, overwhelmed individuals—are doing all the work. They’re trying to save dogs that are starving, tied up in raw sewage, or exposed to the elements, and they’re doing it with little support and no authority. To make matters worse, reports to the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Department often go unanswered, and in many cases, there are serious concerns about how complaints are handled—or ignored altogether. People have documented the failure to act on cruelty cases, misinformation being spread, and neglect of public health issues. Some even suspect systemic corruption. I’ve started a project to share these dogs’ stories and photos to help them get visibility and maybe find homes, but this isn’t just an animal welfare issue—it’s about justice, public health, and accountability in our rural communities.

The mists that cling, a comfort and a shroud, Obscuring peaks that pierce the passing cloud, They whisper secrets to the listening ear, Of time unhurried, banishing all fear.

Though gentle now, my spirit’s keen, A tapestry of evergreen. You boast of youth, and sudden rise, But I have witnessed timeless skies. Your jagged edges, they will wear, While I endure, beyond compare. For strength is not in height alone, But in the long-held, solid stone. I am the bedrock, old and true, And I, young friend, Will outlast you."" A silence fell, the wind did sigh, As clouds moved slowly through the sky.

"Rules of the mountain If you hike where the fog clings low to the pine, And the wind through the holler hums mournful in time, Then heed what the old ones have carved into lore, Or you won’t leave the woods like you’ve left them before. When daylight is dying, be back in your bed, For the dusk wakes the ones that remember the dead. Don’t open for knocking, don’t answer your name, If it stands on two legs but don’t move the same. If you hear a soft song where no singer should be, Keep walking and humming, eyes down, don’t you dare see. Leave bread on the stump if you’ve borrowed the trail, Or the Little Ones curse you with more than just ail. Don’t wave at the figure who waits in the field, It knows you’ve now seen it and won’t stay concealed. Don’t speak of the thing that you glimpsed in the trees, What’s named becomes real, and it’ll find you with ease. If silence falls sudden, then hush every breath, For the quiet in woods is the herald of death. Three pennies at crossroads, don’t ask, just obey, Or you’ll owe a fare that you can’t ever pay. Don’t cut at the oak with a face in the bark, Its roots run through bones buried deep in the dark. If a man joins your fire and don’t meet your gaze, Offer food, speak no questions, and part ways with praise. Don’t fish past the hour when the moon’s at its height, What bites past that mark drags you down out of sight. Mark ash on your door come the coldest of nights, To ward off the shadows that dance without light. If you wake up with dirt on the soles of your feet, Say thanks and lie down, don’t recall, don’t repeat. And pray, not the way that the preacher man said, But the tongue of your grandma, who speaks to the dead.",Southern US,reddit/Appalachia,1690

"Appalachian Outlaw In-between hills, where shadows softly creep, Where the law’s thin hand could barely keep, We did what we must, with hearts both bold and deep, Just to keep our hungry kin from silent weep. They talk now loud, but their knowing is asleep, unaware of all the secrets mountains keep. I used to run shine where the wild winds blow, Through the mountain pass, with a fiery glow, Boot on the gas, pushing hard and low, Law on my back, a hunter I outgrow. Copper stills hiss, a whispered, heated show, Mama prayed hard, for the seeds we’d sow. Taught by my old man, whose heart held ember's heat, Taught me the craft, said ""never retreat."" Scars on my hands, a story incomplete. Fed dogs bark, a sound that can’t defeat, I walk right past, on silent, knowing feet. In these parts, where loyalties run neat, I’m like a blade of grass, in fields of summer wheat. Took my lumps hard, But my spirit stayed complete. Even when they came, with badges sharp and neat, I never cracked, just vanished in the lush green. Took my time, till setting of the sun, Never said a thing, till the hard-won race was run. Pour one out slow, For the ones who faught hard, 'til life’s thread was spun, Outlaws never fold but we carry heavy hearts when all is said and done. They called me criminal, with voices sharp and mean, Said I’d surely burn, in fires yet unseen. But the judge don’t know, how the cold nights intervene, When your kin got mouths, and your gut feels gaunt and lean. You do what you must, a path you must convene, Don’t care what it takes, though the consequences mean. If I fall, bury me, where mossy stones convene, Down by the creek, where the water flows serene. Seen more war in these woods, than their sheltered City eyes have gleaned, I lost blood and good friends, to the lead that intervened. Some to the feds, their wicked plots well-screened, Some to the way of life, a bitter fate uncleaned. But I never did fold, my purpose ever keen, Never lost my nerve, In any harsh ravine. I'm no saint, that much is plain to see, Never claimed that crown, for a sinner such as me. Never backed down, when trouble came so free, Put my truth in the jar, for all the world to heed. My son, the next young soul, beneath the old oak tree, Taught the family code, for all eternity. So if they speak of me, let their voices all agree, I was ten toes deep in mountain smoke, wild and free. my legend walks, where the honeysuckle clings, Through every trail and song the robin sings. Kept my kin fed, when the dinner bell would ring, And I fought the law, Buried many badges deep, And I Dug my own, when my end was soon to be, A life lived hard, in this Appalachian outlaw scene.",Southern US,reddit/Appalachia,2683

Should have used my hand for scale, but it’s a large print. Figured it was a black bear because no one in my household killed Inigo Montoya’s father. Yesterday, I confirmed it because I almost hit the damn thing with the Danger Ranger, coming home from work. He’s. Frickin’. Huge. A giant, majestic floof. Absolutely stunning animal.

"Appalachian Family History I’ve been digging into my family history and found that, up until around 1930, both sides of my family were from places like Jellico, TN and Pike County, KY. These days, most of us are spread out across southern Ohio, northern Kentucky, and West Virginia. The more I research, the more I realize how many of our traditions and ways of life are deeply Appalachian. I’ve always felt something click when I visit places like Scioto County or parts of WV and Ky, like a breath of fresh air, like I’m home. That said, I want to be respectful. I know there are people who were born and raised deep in the mountains and still live that life every day. I don’t want to claim something that isn’t mine to claim, but I also want to feel connected to my roots. Would it be okay to say I have Appalachian roots?",Southern US,reddit/Appalachia,826

"I posted this on tiktok and made a lot of folks mad I'm angry and sad about the entire situation. So many lives lost that could have been prevented. I know, in a perfect world my state wouldn't have voted this way. But I think there is a certain nuance to situations like these that folks who don't live in Appalachia don't understand. I think it comes with so much prejudice towards poor folks that has been hammered into Americans for so long. Folks don't want to acknowledge that there's a system in place keeping the poor down. Keeping education, healthcare, and basic necessities a luxury, so that they keep voting against their own interests. I don't think these folks can comprehend a life where you have to chose between working as a kid to provide for your siblings or going to school. I don't think they can comprehend what it might be like to not be able to read or write as an adult. Kentucky has 37.5% of adults reading between a 3rd and 8th grade level. I don't think they can comprehend that some folks don't even have access to reliable Internet. I see folks making comparison to the LA wildfires and saying they are just ""giving it back"" because folks were saying it was God's judgement to California. That shit wasn't right in the slightest, but you know what the difference is? A lot of folks in LA are wealthy and have somewhere to go. We heard about it for months. There were fundraisers hosted by the NFL and celebrities, but this will be lost in the news cycle within the next couple of days. I see a lot of similarities between this and hurricane Katrina. A lot of those victims were simply forgotten and blamed because they were poor and lived in a red state. But they didn't deserve it. They didn't vote for that. Sorry for the long rant but I long for the day when folks can see Appalachia for the beautiful and complex place that it is, instead of using it as a scapegoat to ignore their own prejudice and hate towards the less fortunate and disenfranchised. I know there are many hateful Appalachians but like everywhere in the world the good folks always outweigh the bad. The revolution is going to have folks from all walks of life. Especially poor folks. Why kick them when they're down?",Southern US,reddit/Appalachia,2220
