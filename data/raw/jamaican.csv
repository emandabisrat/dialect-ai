"How is Jamaica Doing These Days With Ultra-processed Food? Didn't grow up in Jamaica, but my family is from there. One thing I've always loved about it is that the people always seem to avoid too much ultra-processed food (aside from KFC). Is it still like that? Or is it gradually changing? Haven't been back in a while, but feel like they could be an excellent model for the rest of the world in terms of dietary habits.",Jamaican,reddit/Jamaica,422
