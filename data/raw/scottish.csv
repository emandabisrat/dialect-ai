"J K Rowling new fund, to waste Scottish tax payers money. So J.K. Rowling has set up the “J.K. Rowling Women’s Fund” (JKRWF). She’s not accepting donations, because she’s bankrolling it herself. On the surface, it claims to protect “sex-based rights,” but when you dig in, it’s very clearly about one thing: funding legal action to exclude trans women from public life especially places like schools, the NHS, and prisons. And guess who pays for all the fallout from that? Us, The Scottish taxpayer. The real cost of her court cases will be the Scottish tax payier. Her fund supports lawsuits and tribunal cases against public services places run with your tax money. Schools, hospitals, councils, women’s shelters, the police. Every time one of her cases goes to court, these institutions have to spend your money to defend themselves. If they lose, they pay damages and legal fees. If they win, they still burn through cash and time that should be going to actual services. She spends a few grand? We end up footing a bill in the hundreds of thousands. These lawsuits aren’t about protecting anyone. They’re about forcing public services to change policies that include trans people. That means expensive overhauls of staff training, signage, protocols more money wasted to appease a personal vendetta. And all while the NHS is on its knees, schools are underfunded, and councils are going bankrupt. But instead, she chose to create a legal fund targeting one of the most marginalised groups in society. Trans people especially trans women ,are already at greater risk of homelessness, violence, and suicide. This fund makes all of that worse. Nobody voted for this. It’s not protecting women, it’s fuelling a media-frenzied culture war that’s actively harming people. And it's being done with the resources of the public sector tied up in expensive court cases. J.K. Rowling is not being silenced. She’s using her wealth to bully trans people through the legal system, and the Scottish public is paying the price.",Scottish,reddit/Scotland,2016

"DIY divorce in Scotland I relocated to Scotland with my ex back in 2023, however, things have not gone well and had to leave. We had agreed on the DIY divorce back then before I left which is based on both parties consent after one year of separation, however when push came to shove she changed her mind. By the time two years of separation would have gone by for me to apply for it without her consent, my UK visa would have expired and I won't be able to travel back there to apply for it. I read online that it could be applied for remotely, however, i did not find anything useful regarding the process, especially since I won't be a legal resident there by then. Honestly all of this is new to me, and know no one who's gone through a similar process to offer any guidance. I don't even know what questions do I have to get answers to. All I know is that I won't be there to apply for it in person, and that I won't be a legal resident by then. She would still be there, but we're not in touch at the moment so I'm not sure if she has or is planning to change her domicile address,.. I don't know what I should know about the process. Literally anything would help. Thank you very much in advance and have a great day.",Scottish,reddit/Scotland,1224
"Why are there so many non-Scottish voices in spoken Scottish media? We have a wealth of diversity within Scotland, with people from every possible social and ethnic group, all with one of the many different types of Scottish accents and languages. Our English language media is massively dominated with English, American, and other non-Scottish voices. I'm glad all that is available to us, it allows us to see the similarities across, and the diversity of, the English speaking world. Scotland has a comparatively tiny media, disproportionately small compared with other nations of 5.5 million people. And it's great to welcome those people who grew up outwith Scotland who have chosen to make it their home. But Scottish produced media quite obviously has a massive over representation of voices that are not from Scotland. Do you think it's because we collectively hate the sounds of our own voices? Or that they're somehow not good enough? Or that the people making the decisions are from outwith Scotland? What's going on here?",Scottish,reddit/Scotland,1032
"Waterproof coats? I've lived in Scotland for four years now, and one crucial thing that I still do not have is a proper waterproof coat. I've tried a few different ones (first a cheap one from Matalan, then a more expensive one from Mountain Warehouse, and a second-hand Karrimor most recently) and none of them actually keep the water out. For all of them, the sleeves seem to be the worst offenders, they soak through in minutes and the torso part eventually follows suit, if a bit more gradually. Which brands would you recommend for coats that actually keep you dry in this Scottish weather? Please. I'm desperate. The heat wave seems to be over, and I'm once again having to walk the dog and make my way to work in the rain. I don't mind paying a bit more at this point, as I have now learned that the cheap ones seem to be utter rubbish.",Scottish,reddit/Scotland,843

"The Jocks and the Geordies. Who remembers the Jocks & the Geordies from the Dandy? It got me thinking and there's always been this kind of affinity with the Scots and the people from Newcastle. Growing up in the 90's I used to listen to hardcore music and there was a DJ from Newcastle called Bass Generator that used to always come up and play in Scotland. He used to play at the REZ and Judgement Day events in Edinburgh and at the Fubar club in Stirling. Had some fucking amazing nights there. Then there was the story about a group of guys from Newcastle that used to drive North every Friday night in their van until they could tune in to Tom Wilson's Stepping Out radio show on Forth FM. You never really hear much these days about the Geordies and Scots being bros, but maybe I'm just getting old and out of touch? Is it still a thing?",Scottish,reddit/Scotland,842

"Cammanachd - Have you played? Hello! While I'm not Scottish, as I don't live there, contribute to the economy, or vote in Scotland or the UK, I have a deep appreciation for your country and a genuine curiosity about its cultures, particularly right now regarding the sport of camanachd. I’m interested in exploring the prevalence of this sport below the Highland Line. Is camanachd taught and played in schools in those areas below the line? Have you played? What was your experience like? Additionally, I'm curious about the accessibility of the sport. How easy is it to find pick-up games or community events for those interested in playing in urban areas? For individuals who are passionate about camanachd, how inclusive is the community for players below the Highland Line? I think camanachd is a thrilling game to watch, and it seems equally exciting to play. Documentaries have highlighted its significance in the Highlands and Islands, showcasing how it fosters extremely deep community bonds and camaraderie among participants and fans. It appears to serve as a positive outlet for youth and adults, offering an alternative to challenges such as alcoholism, substance abuse and mental health struggles, which can be prevalent in some highland areas. I'm also pondering whether the lack of abundant positive opportunities for youth in the Highlands has contributed to camanachd becoming a central element of community life, or if it always has been. Furthermore, in regions where camanachd may not be as prevalent, does football fill that role instead? I would love and appreciate to hear more about the community dynamics, the growth of camanachd in various regions to the south, and how it compares to other sports in terms of engagement and support. Thank you!",Scottish,reddit/Scotland,1771
"How to respect local culture as an international student? Hi to all of you, I'm an 18 year old Zambian ( Barotseland specifically) girl interested in studying in one of your universities, I just want to know what life is like in your country for a foreigner, more specifically an international student. I come from a strictly insular, isolationist culture and community and when I say strictly, I mean strictly, we're not supposed to be defectors ( living in different countries, marrying out, eating different foods, having friends outside the group etc.). What can I do to practice this without disrespecting your nation, my people are docile and non confrontational, so I don't wish to cause problems, we don't have any diaspora so I won't have a community in Scotland , what advice would you give me to make sure I do NOT disrespect you or your nation in any way? I don't plan to live here as it's not my country but since I'll be your guest what should I avoid doing in your country? What are some things I should know? Please, I don't mean any harm and I don't wish to dishonour my people or yours. Edit: there have been a lot of comments on here pointing out the racism of my cultural beliefs and I actually agree with you. If I hadn't asked this here I wouldn't have known, I thank all of you who called me out for it. I admit a lot of the things I believed and posted were disgusting, I actively participated in these backward beliefs and although I can't change the past , the more I interact with you the more I feel embarrassed with myself and this embarrassment causes a change. So thank you, for showing me how much of a racist cunt I was, I can't apologize enough and I've started to question my culture and our beliefs and how it might actually be a cult, it's somewhat scary to find that out but it was extremely important that I did. Thank you for calling me out and honestly feel free to give me more judgement, I deserve it.",Scottish,reddit/Scotland,1944

"Is anyone worried about the trouble these browns are causing? So I try to be a fair and reasonable person, but I live near these people, and I swear every week I'm reading something in the newpaper about all the troubles they're causing. First off, they just seem to keep pumping out kids. The eldest is about 30, and the youngest seems to be about 4. I think they have about 8 kids in total, and it seems like at some point they gave up even naming their own kids, calling them ""the twins"" and ""the bairn"". I feel sorry for the poor mother, I dont know how she can keep doing this at her age. They all live in the same house, with the exception of their grandfather. I've passed by a few times, and the noise they create is diabolical. I heard them the other day arguing about playing Jimmy Shand on a gramophone. Who even has a gramophone in this day and age? The eldest children seem to spend half their lives on the pull, and I don't think I've ever seen one come back with the same partner twice. While I don't want to shame anyone for their lifestyle choices, I wonder what makes them so unlikeable theyre incapable of getting a second date? I don't think a single one of them is in full time employment. They're happy to keep having children, and the whole lot seem like a bunch of benefit scroungers. Honestly, its making me think about leaving Glebe Street. I guess it could be worse though, my uncle works for the police, and he's constantly being terrorised by a gang of youths led by a lad in dungarees.",Scottish,reddit/Scotland,1515

"Shared Boundary Fence - Troubles with Neighbour Hello! Seeking some (potential) legal advice/understanding. On the deeds to our land it states that the boundary fence between ours and the neighbours is mutually owned, with maintenance to be carried out by both parties. (From my understanding, common in Scots Law). The owners of the house don’t live there, they instead rent it out to tenants. During the big storms in February the fence slats (not the posts) had came down, and we had repaired the fence and ensured it was still standing. The fence generally was in quite a poor state of disrepair, we have only owned the property for two years, and it was/has been in this state since we took ownership. The only maintenance the owners of the adjacent land claim to undertake is painting it on their side (we’ve never seen them at the house before). The tenants over the last month/months had moved out, and we have seen essentially nobody coming and going to the property during this time. We had plans to remove the fence and replace it with a fence which was more sturdy, in better condition, and taller (still under the 2m height). Because the house had sat empty for a number of weeks we took the decision to take down the fence slats and put up a new fence. We haven’t removed the existing posts, and instead the new posts were fixed more clearly in our side of the boundary line - this was not for any intention other than avoiding tree roots which had taken root and made putting posts in on the actual boundary line very difficult. So the boundary/shared fence still has posts, and the new posts are firmly in our land. The slats were completely and utterly rotten, poorly maintained, and crumbling apart - there was no possible way they could be salvaged. We would have liked the chance to let them know of our plans, but with no way to get in contact with them, and the fear of the fence potentially coming down again and injuring our dog, we took the decision to just do the upgrade. We mistakenly thought they’d appreciate a new, higher quality fence that they didn’t have to pay a penny for. They’ve shown up recently to do garden maintenance for their next tenant to take the lease, and have taken umbrage against us for having taken down the shared fence and are threatening that we return it (impossible due to the condition) or build a new shared fence on the boundary line.
