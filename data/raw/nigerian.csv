"r/Nigeria Community Rules Update. PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING AND COMMENTING. Sequel to the two previous posts and regarding the state of the subreddit, this post will contain the new and updated community rules. Kindly read this thread before posting, especially if you are a new user. You can check the results of the votes cast #Based on what you voted, 5 of the new rules are as follows: 1. If you post a link to a news article, you must follow up with a comment about your thoughts regarding the content of the news article you just posted. **Exceptions will only be made for important breaking news articles.** The point of this rule is to reduce and/or eliminate the number of bots and users who just spam the sub with links to news articles, and to also make sure this sub isn't just overrun with news articles. **ADDITIONALLY:** If you post images and videos that contain or make reference to data, a piece of information or an excerpt from a news piece, kindly add a source in the comments or your post will be removed. 2. Posts from blog and tabloid websites that deal with gossip and sensationalized pieces, e.g., Linda Ikeji Blog, Instablog, etc. will no longer be allowed except in special cases. 3. There will be no limit on the number of posts a user can make in a day. However, if the moderators notice that you are making too many posts that flood the sub and make it look like you are spamming, your posts may still be removed. 4. The Weeky Discussion thread will be brought back in due time. 5. You can make posts promoting your art projects, music, film, documentary, or any other relevant personal projects as long as you are a Nigerian and/or they are in some way related to Nigeria. However, posts that solicit funds, link to shady websites, or pass as blatant advertising will be removed. If you believe your case is an exception, you can reach out to the moderators. _____ #CLARIFICATION/MODIFICATION OF OTHER RULES: **1.

This community is meant for any and all Nigerians regardless of their religious beliefs or ethnicity. **2. THE LGBTQIA+ COMMUNITY:** As the sidebar reads, this is a safe space for LGBTQIA+ Nigerians. Their rights and existence are not up for debate under any condition.

"Stop shipping back your kids I was sent to Ghana for nine years. And guess what? I still can‚Äôt speak my native tongue properly. I didn‚Äôt fit in there, and I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone. I was always a quiet kid, and everyone thought they could ‚Äúforce‚Äù the quietness out of me ‚Äî but it never worked. Maybe I‚Äôm neurodivergent, maybe I just didn‚Äôt fit in socially. But forcing me into an environment like that made it worse, not better. I stood out even after nine years. I never fully felt like I belonged there, and people could still tell I wasn‚Äôt originally from Ghana. So what exactly did it fix? Nothing. I‚Äôm not even saying you shouldn‚Äôt let your child learn about their roots ‚Äî of course it‚Äôs good for a child to understand their heritage. But please, do not confuse cultural exposure with punishment. You want them to connect with their identity? ‚Ä¢ Send them on holiday to visit family. ‚Ä¢ Let them stay for a year in a safe, loving environment ‚Äî not a strict institution. ‚Ä¢ Speak your native tongue to them at home. ‚Ä¢ Let them read books, watch African shows, talk to elders. ‚Ä¢ Actually educate them ‚Äî don‚Äôt abandon them. Because sending your kid straight from the UK to a boarding school in Africa ‚Äî especially when they didn‚Äôt see it coming ‚Äî is cruel. Some of those schools feel like prison camps. The caning, the early wake-ups, the isolation. It doesn‚Äôt build character. It breaks it. In my case, I wasn‚Äôt even misbehaving. It was just about ‚Äúlearning culture.‚Äù But nine years? You can‚Äôt tell me that‚Äôs necessary. They could‚Äôve cut it short. They could‚Äôve done better. So I‚Äôm saying this clearly: Stop sending your kids to boarding schools in Africa as a solution. Stop lying to them about it. Stop calling it ‚Äúdiscipline.‚Äù Stop using culture as a cover for cruelty. If your child is struggling with behavior or you‚Äôre scared they‚Äôre heading toward danger ‚Äî do your job as a parent. Get therapy. Talk to a school counselor. Go to youth support services. Involve junior police programs if you must. But do not abandon your child because parenting became hard. If you‚Äôre not ready to deal with the worst sides of parenting, you shouldn‚Äôt be a parent.

"My Brother's Scholarship to Finland üá´üáÆ- 9 months UPDATE. Hello Reddit family, It‚Äôs been a while since our last update ‚Äî almost 8 months now ‚Äî and we felt it was time to share how the experience has been. A lot has happened since then ‚Äî the good, the bad, and the real‚Äîand we‚Äôre grateful to still be here, growing, learning, and adapting. First, we want to say a big thank you to everyone who supported us the last time we shared our story. Your kindness, advice, encouragement, and even support meant more than you can imagine. We never left this group ‚Äî we‚Äôve just been deep in the thick of the experience, trying to stay afloat and achieve something meaningful. Living in Finland has been a blend of beauty, struggle, growth, and resilience. My brother has now been here for nearly 9 months, and while the road hasn‚Äôt been easy, it‚Äôs been deeply transformative. The Winter Challenge Coming from Nigeria, a warm country, nothing could have prepared him for the Finnish winter. Temperatures dropped to -17 and sometimes to -23¬∞C, and there were days he had to walk long distances with frozen feet and numb fingers ‚Äîtrying to reach school when his bus pass has expired or in search of job opportunities. It is tough, sometimes even surreal, but he‚Äôs adapted more than we ever thought possible. And surprisingly, he says he‚Äôs come to enjoy the cold ‚Äî it builds something in you, he says. The Job Hunt This remains the hardest part. Despite applying for over 150 jobs, attending multiple interviews, and visiting offices in person, the results have been the same: ""No openings"" It‚Äôs discouraging, yes, but he hasn‚Äôt let it break him. He‚Äôs still pushing, still learning the language slowly, and still showing up. At one point, he made a heartfelt post in a local Facebook group about needing a job. That post ended up going viral. A lot people at his school and local community saw it. Teachers came up to him to check on him and offered words of encouragement. People understood. They knew how hard things are, and they showed compassion. A complete stranger ‚Äî a Finnish person ‚Äî even sent him a ‚Ç¨50 gift card to buy food during Ramadan as a result of the Facebook post. That meant so much, especially at a time when he had nothing. It‚Äôs wild how one post asking for help can bring out so much love from people you‚Äôve never met. The job situation in Finland right now is tough‚Äînot just for newcomers like my brother, but even for Finnish citizens. We‚Äôve come across people who‚Äôve had their working hours cut so companies can spread the limited hours across more employees. It‚Äôs a way to help more people earn something, but it also shows how serious the unemployment issue is. So it‚Äôs not just him‚Äîit‚Äôs a nationwide challenge, and even locals are feeling the pressure. Hopefully, things improve soon for everyone. The Silver Lining: School and Support Where things have been difficult on one side, they‚Äôve been incredibly fulfilling on another. He‚Äôs studying mechanical welding at his vocational school, and it‚Äôs something he‚Äôs truly passionate about.‚Äî working with machines, cutting, measuring, practicing all kinds of welding techniques: stick, MIG/MAG, TIG. He‚Äôs already done multiple fabrication projects, like building a miniature stainless steel wind turbine (which he‚Äôs really proud of), and he‚Äôs learning to use CNC and bending machines. Another fulfilling projects he worked on was making a recoil hammer. It looked simple, but it taught him a lot. He had to machine three metal rods, cut them into four parts, add a grip, and assemble them according to given dimensions. No step-by-step instructions ‚Äî just the parts and a drawing. Seeing it come together with his own hands was a real confidence booster. It‚Äôs intense and hands-on, and even though he still needs a lot of practice, he‚Äôs excited about how far he‚Äôs come and everything he‚Äôs learned in just one year. He‚Äôs grateful to be there, and he‚Äôs looking forward to having an even better and more productive second year as his first year wraps up. We've also put together a short video montage to give a better sense of what he‚Äôs been up to ‚Äî snowy walks to school, hands-on training, his projects, and the general vibe of life there. Finland is cold, but beautiful in its own way. And watching him adapt to it has been incredible. The video adds some context and shows the kind of growth that words alone can‚Äôt capture. One thing we didn‚Äôt expect ‚Äî but are so grateful for ‚Äî is the level of support he‚Äôs received from fellow Nigerians in Finland. People from all over ‚Äî Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba, Muslim, Christian ‚Äî have shown up for him in big ways. Nigerians have this incredible ability to form community wherever they are, and my brother has seen the best of that. Especially from the local Muslim and Yoruba communities, who have helped with food, rent, and even job referrals. It‚Äôs been proof that Nigerians are a force for good all around the world. Unfortunately, we sometimes get a bad rap because of a few bad eggs, and yes, there‚Äôs discrimination here and there. But overwhelmingly, the love he‚Äôs received from fellow Nigerians has been genuine and unconditional. And that has made a world of difference. Still Standing, Still Hoping We won‚Äôt pretend everything is perfect. He still doesn‚Äôt have a job, he‚Äôs behind on some rent, and recently got a notice from a debt collection agency regarding school-related materials. We're sharing this not to complain, but to give an honest picture of the journey so far. It hasn't been easy, but he's still here ‚Äî learning, growing, and doing his best to keep moving forward. And we believe better days are ahead. Finland is still a wonderful country ‚Äî safe, peaceful, full of kind people and great systems. The struggle right now doesn‚Äôt change that. It‚Äôs just part of the path, and we believe this path will eventually lead to something great. Thanks again to everyone who‚Äôs been supporting him ‚Äî here on Reddit, on Facebook, or in real life. Every kind word, every piece of advice, every bit of encouragement has meant something. We don‚Äôt take it lightly. Here‚Äôs to surviving year one ‚Äî and hopefully, thriving in year two. üí™üèΩ With love, Saheed & Brother",Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,6165
"Enough with the pot bellies I‚Äôm actually going to start calling attention to how visibly discomforting seeing men with those massive oversized bellies with dropping chests is. Outside of making all those men look weak, it‚Äôs undignified to carry around that belly in public. Ignoring the appearance, the cause is even worse. Men eating four meals or more in the day with each being full of oil, rice, and poultry. No nutrition, all fat, spice, and oil. Men with bellies like that are constantly looking for food all the time. No time to think about sharing the food available with others, no time to think about how much you‚Äôre eating, only time to gorge and drink. Obesity related deaths account for the highest portion of premature casualties (especially among adult men) and no one is calling attention to how bad the situation is getting.",Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,841

"Justice for Hamdiya Reading about the recent kidnap and attempt ed murder of Hamdiya Sidi-Ali sent chills through my spine, a teenager going through such inhuman treatment because she dared to speak truth to power, betrayed by a governor whose responsibility it is to ensure the security of the lives and property of the good people of Sokoto state, betrayed by the police whose constitutional role it is to police the society and protect the citizens from any form of harm, betrayed by a society that won't stand up enmass against injustice. It's so painful that she and her loved ones alone had to go through this, the people she fights for do not know their left from their right, they all sit cowardly and watch while the ruling elites abuse power and pilfer the state's resources, and then, criticize the one who dared to speak up on behalf of the masses. Who are we exactly? This is just one case out of many, where some DISSIDENTS have been used as scape-goat to deter any form of accountability demand, by the leadership of this country. It however makes me wonder how much longer we would have to continue like this in a so-called democratic system. Our leaders believe in democracy when it comes to defending and protecting their rights to be in office, but when it comes to upholding the rule of law while discharging their constitutional role, they vehemently throw aside the democratic rhetorics, revealing the ugly dictator in them. Maybe the leadership is truly a reflection of who we are as a people, and perhaps right it is. Hamdiya got picked up, drugged, and left to die in an unknown location. Luckily for her, she was found and taken to the hospital. For what exactly?... Because she relentlessly, despite her haven being persecuted in the past, continued to criticize the leadership of Sokoto state, demanding for good governance to the people. If the people of Sokoto state still cannot see that their leadership is their true enemy by this acts, then they truly deserve the worst they're yet to experience. I just cannot fathom the rationale behind a seating governor using the instrument of the police and the judiciary to persecute a teenage girl. I'm so gutted right now, and wish for speedy justice for Hamdiya. I call upon the governor to append his resignation, the inspector general of police to punish and resind the batches of those police officers directly involved in this case. I call on the good people of Sokoto state, to rally enmass on the street of Sokoto shouting, raising placards, demanding for justice. This is not only about Hamdiya, it's a punitive call to end the persecution of people who criticize government. Nigerians need to start standing for each other against the true enemies of the state.",Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,2746
"$67.5M Lost to Denied Visas: Is the West Punishing Poorer African Nations? In 2024 alone, African countries lost a staggering $67.5 million to denied visa applications to Europe. Let that sink in: **we're literally paying to be rejected.** A new report shows that rejection rates remain disproportionately high for African nations, especially the poorer ones. Countries like **Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria** face rejection rates of **40‚Äì50%**, yet each application costs upwards of $100 in non-refundable fees. To make it worse, the trend hasn't changed from 2023 - in fact, it's *gotten worse*. The poorer the country, the more likely your visa gets denied. And no, they don‚Äôt even have to give you a reason. This isn't just about travel. It's about opportunity, dignity, and the blatant gatekeeping of the global north. Why are we still paying into a system that seems designed to say **no** to us? Some questions for discussion: * Should African governments start demanding **reciprocal visa fees or refund policies**? * How can we hold these embassies accountable for such a rigged system? * Should there be a **continental response or boycott** to these visa injustices? Let's talk. Because if you ask me, $67.5 million could‚Äôve gone to building something real - not into the pockets of rejection machines.",Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,1310

Am I being overdramatic? So me and my father do not have a good relationship at all I hold a lot of resentment for him for the way he‚Äôs treated me and I fear him a lot bc he would beat me when I was younger as well as the fact he isn‚Äôt someone I feel I can really talk to about my problems because he often makes me feel bad about them such as I told him I‚Äôm doing a gap year to reapply to medicine and he first asked what would I do if I don‚Äôt get in the second time which I‚Äôve given some thought about ofc but wasn‚Äôt really hoping to hear that from him. If I‚Äôm being honest my resentment towards him stems from the beatings i received as a child which I do not believe was justified. My first memory of him was him scraping the flesh off my skin when I got a temporary tattoo from a yogurt maybe when I was 4 or 5. I told him this because he‚Äôs asked why I fear him now even though he doesn‚Äôt hit me anymore which I believe is because I now defend myself he said it‚Äôs discipline and that it‚Äôs legal. Please tell me if I‚Äôm being overdramatic about this bc ik it‚Äôs common in Nigeria culture to beat your kids but I wasn‚Äôt raised in Nigeria and i believe physical harm does no good however I‚Äôve seen other posts that say their father beat them and it made them respect him after awhile when they grew up my father said the same thing about his dad I‚Äôm 18 right now but I‚Äôm not feeling that way so I‚Äôd like to know other peoples opinions Edit: also I‚Äôd like to mention that whenever we get into arguments and I say nasty stuff he brings up that hes done everything for me raised me etc and that he doesn‚Äôt deserve this and because of this I often feel bad that I don‚Äôt like him that much,Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,1684

"We really need to document our TFR and population properly. We are completely relying on foreign organizations for the data, and most of their figures are purely estimates. Nigeria's TFR in 2013 was estimated to be around 5.74 children per woman. This fell to around 4.48 in 2023, 10 years later. These are the figures from 2013‚Äì2023: 5.74, 5.66, 5.62, 5.58, 5.52, 5.45, 5.38, 5.31, 4.64, 4.48. This means that the total decrease over 10 years = 5.74 - 4.48 = 1.26, or an average of 0.126 per year. Here is the problem with this data: if you look closely, the TFR or at least the recorded TFR barely dropped over the years until the UNICEF MICS survey was conducted. Then it found that our TFR was significantly lower than what was actually recorded. To put this into context, if the rate of 0.126 per year is constant meaning that it doesn't drop or increase any faster‚Äîthis would be our TFR over the decades: * 2030s (average year 2035): 4.48 - (0.126 √ó 12) = 4.48 - 1.512 = 2.97 * 2040s (average year 2045): 2.97 - (0.126 √ó 10) = 2.97 - 1.26 = 1.71 * 2050s (average year 2055): 1.71 - (0.126 √ó 10) = 1.71 - 1.26 = 0.45 * 2060s (average year 2065): 0.45 - (0.126 √ó 10) = 0.45 - 1.26 = -0.81 (capped at 0, as TFR cannot be negative). What makes this even more concerning is that the Federal Government is incompetent and doesn't accurately record data, meaning that we have to rely on predictions and estimations from world organizations. For example, the prediction from the UN for 2023 was 4.48 children per woman, but that TFR is completely wrong since the TFR recorded by UNICEF during the MICS survey in 2021 was 4.6. We really need to be sure about this data, or we will face a massive crisis in the future one without any solution. The next MICS survey will be either this year or next year, and that will tell us how our TFR is doing whether it has stabilized or fallen even further. But if we see as big of a drop between 2021 and 2026 as we saw from 2017 to 2021, then the Federal Government will have to start taking immediate action. That would mean we will likely never reach 400 million in population, and that our demographic dividend is a lot closer than we ever thought.",Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,2188
"Looking for an estranged family members Good day to you all. My grandmother was the last child of her family before her Yoruba father abandoned her and moved back to his state, Lagos. He left my grandmother with her Fulani Mother and his other son (Duro) in Kano. He got remarried and barely visited her and she didn‚Äôt want to have anything to do with him although her brother didn‚Äôt have the same approach. He stayed very close to him, visiting him every weekend he got. He eventually passed away before my grandmother got married, she didn‚Äôt want to go to his funeral because he was a wealthy man and she had the tribalistic notion that Yoruba people can curse you for inheritance. But as we all know that didn‚Äôt stop her brother. Her half brother (Kayodele, I believe) reached out to her but he shortly died thereafter. And her only other link to him and his other family, Duro had passed away in the 90s. So I‚Äôm writing here because I, my mother and her sisters want to know who their other family members are and perhaps they already know them. His name was Josiah Hanson.

"Politics in the workplace What's with politics in the workplace? At my work place years ago, I was close with all bosses until I went for NYSC and I noticed some changes but I was still close with overall boss and never have I ever discussed anything work related just advices and family stuff. Forward to now the Boss was replaced for almost 2 years although I noticed being targeted and all but I never knew it was bad until recently. Shocked to realize that I was labeled a snitch just because I was closed with the former boss. Mind you I would have gone with the former boss when he request from the HR department but I shot the idea down. Bottom line I had to apologize so that I can breathe. I'm more pained that I thought we were family but how could they think if me like that. Mind you I wasn't the only one close with the former boss but why was I the target? ü§î",Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,872

"Rome 2000 Years Ago vs Africa 'An Hour Ago' ‚Äì A Racist Meme or a Deeper Wake-Up Call? Came across this image on Facebook (attached) and was stunned by the layers of bias, ignorance, and blatant racism it represents.

"Views of racism by skin colour NB Please also read the EDIT below ..... Original Post: Im from Europe and wanted to ask views of people from Africa, I tend to read the Nigerian subreddit a good bit so Im posting here...not just the Nigerian subreddit I do some 'travelling' to other subreddits ha. I think people would agree that every country has an element of racism. Others may disagree on the following view but in my own view it's a by-product of community ie the 'us v them' attitude that a community can have. When people are together there is always 'another'. I have a recent vague theory, which is based on little fact. My theory is that white and black people tend to the most racist. The reason that may be the case is because we have the most 'extreme' skin colours and therefore have a greater tendency to form the 'other' in our minds. It could be my imagination but for instance I seem to have noticed that latinos, who would have a greater tendancy to have brown or olive (or whatever you want to term it) skin tone so a mix, tend to discuss or consider skin colour less? On reddit forums but also from travelling there too. Or maybe this is all just my imagination. I'm not here to have a go at white or black people just my thoughts which is based on little fact. EDIT: Im seeing comments that white people have been and continue to be the ones doing the discrimination, not black people. Which is correct. HOWEVER countries with lighter skin hold the power. There are historic reasons why I think that is the case (ultimately I think it boils down to the North being colder - for instance, need for oil, gas, housing etc, which has meant that the North has had to put a more complex system in place for this. Topic for another day). The one who holds the power is the one that can oppress. For instance, try oppressing your boss at work and see how far you get with that. But it can easily happen the other way around. I've perceived that both white people and black people tend to focus on skin colour more than mixed colour people. Or that could be just my imagination. So focus on skin colour, casual racism, that type of thing. NOT oppression / using power over other people.",Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,2199

"We all can't be right ‚ÄéI got myself caught up in a discussion with a lady on Twitter over some religious matters; me being Muslim, and she Christian. ‚Äé ‚ÄéUnderstandably, she had some opinions regarding Islam, which, after I had seen them, I thought to educate her on why her thoughts might be misconceived and wrong. We got talking, and no matter how much I tried to make her see that her views were black and white, not necessarily following the machination of the Almighty's way of doing things ‚Äì as we humans love to judge God's actions through our limited human lenses ‚Äì this lady wouldn't budge. ‚Äé ‚ÄéShe was persistent, firm in what she was saying, claiming it to be the truth, whilst disregarding anything that doesn't weave into her psychology and narrative. She was blantantly adamant, dismissive, and frankly, I don't blame her. It's her belief, who was I to hold her against it? ‚Äé ‚ÄéAfterall, we could argue on this religion thing from now till the world goes boom! and both of us may not even see the light of God, talk more of entering Paradise. ‚Äé ‚ÄéBut honestly, I would have loved her to see that, ideally, two truths can have room to coexist, no matter how distinct they are from one another. I have my own truths, things that make up my own belief system ‚Äì narratives that I have cross-checked, read, and researched upon to have arrived at them. ‚Äé ‚ÄéAnd I am proud to wear it on me like a badge. ‚Äé ‚ÄéHaving someone come out of nowhere to say that my perspective and idealogy is wrong, bad, and outrightly false, even after giving you points and reasons on how I have come to this, speaks on the person's level of intellect and perception. ‚Äé ‚ÄéIn hindsight, I had commended her for reading up so much about the religion, but sadly, I could see how narrow and biased ‚Äì especially that last one ‚Äì her views about Islam was. Can you imagine that she refuted and refused that Islam is part of the three original Abrahamic religions? And in spite of my arguments against such thought process, stating how it's almost impossible to extricate Islam from among the Abrahamic religions, she still refused to acknowledge it! ‚Äé ‚ÄéA religious pseudo-intellectual in one corner of Africa thinks that Islam doesn't have what it takes to be counted as one of the Abrahamic religions! If that doesn't scream bias and hate and craziness, I don't know what does. ‚Äé ‚ÄéIt was confounding to read that from her, amongst many other things that I read from her two days ago. After reading through her comments carefully, all of it, I just shook my head and concluded that there was nothing I could say that would change this one's mind. Her bias had taken root into her psyche, and there was no way of pulling her out. ‚Äé ‚ÄéWell, all these didn't vex me that much ‚Äì I have met many like her, though not as stubborn ‚Äì what had really riled me up the most was her not replying my messages after all I had sent her! And I had sent her a whole lot, hoping it might soften her bias a little bit. ‚Äé ‚ÄéHer argument was that my points were baseless and lacked any real justification to the things she believes Islam is lacking. And so, she couldn't bother replying my messages. She even added that she wasn't expecting any credible points from me, as many of it would be steeped in blind defense of my religion and would lack any form of intellectual congruity. ‚Äé ‚ÄéEven after that show of arrogance, I still tried to nudge her heavily-biased, steel-like thinking to a more liberal corner, and yet...nothing. That was when I got my cue to let her be. ‚Äé ‚ÄéI was wrong, and to think I saw her as an intelligent person. ‚Äé ‚ÄéP.S; If you have any view about Islam, and you're not willing to learn but to assert your views on me, I beg you in whatever you believe in, keep it to yourself.

"Why are Nigerians quick to dismiss or downplay the achievements of other Nigerians, especially when compared to their International Counterparts? Obviously, not every Nigerian does this, but it's common enough to be a problem. A while back, I saw people talking about how Nigerian billionaires aren't anything impressive compared to billionaires in other countries and how all their wealth was solely created through government contracts. I have also heard takes like ""Nigerian billionaires and the companies especially banks don't contribute to jobs or wealth creation in the country,"" or takes like ""No Nigerian CEO can be headhunted by Western corporations."" And it's not just businessmen. This rhetoric is also pushed onto educated people, ministers, etc. I think we associate an English accent with being well-learned, which is silly and self-hating. But above everything, this is so hypocritical considering how Nigerians whine on a daily basis about how Nigeria is so lawless and not a ""sane climate,"" and how it holds them back. But somehow, this criticism isn't extended to people like this. To top it all off, the people who always push these criticisms aren't even successful founders themselves, but random people not even related to the industry they criticize. Now, I'm not trying to say Nigerian elites are blameless or innocent, but I find it funny when people are suddenly fine with elites in other countries (who do the same shit, or even worse) but absolutely despise our home-grown elites.",Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,1509

"Nigeria might be better off with natural disasters I actually believe in environmental eugenics. The reason why we have so many stupid leaders and a stupid population is that we don‚Äôt have the seasons or natural disasters to wipe out people who waste resources. The best we have is flood and traffic and that can be mitigating by owning an SUV. I wish we had earthquakes, tsunamis and tornadoes that made planes impossible to fly so that our leaders would be stuck there. If they like they can drive 100 cars in their convoy, if a tsunami happens and they looted the funds for adequate drainage and infrastructure they would be swept away too. Our climate is too nice, nothing ever happens, you can technically live in a mudhut for centuries and only storms here and there might mildly inconvenience you. We also never had the need to build mega structures that could withstand the cold winters. All these things led to certain personality types thriving rather than being killed off, people like Tinubus ancestors would‚Äôve died in winter since, he probably wouldn‚Äôt even exist.

"How I quietly fixed my USDT-to-Naira stress ‚Äî and ended up building something better Hi all, I‚Äôm sharing this because I know many Nigerians are in the same boat I was in a few months ago‚Äîstruggling with the back-and-forth of converting crypto (especially USDT) to Naira smoothly. If you‚Äôve ever been ghosted on a P2P trade, received a fake alert, or waited two hours for a payment that never came‚Äîyou know how tiring it can get. I went through that cycle more times than I care to admit. Eventually, I got fed up and decided to do something about it. Along with a few others, I built a tool that I now use myself: it allows you to convert stablecoins like USDT directly to Naira **without going through P2P at all**. * The money lands in your wallet (or bank) in less than 30 seconds * It works with other coins too: USDC, BTC, ETH, BNB, etc. * No haggling, no middlemen, no drama * You can also spend or send directly from inside the app We made it simple on purpose. No pop-ups. No ads. No trading noise. It‚Äôs been quietly running for about 5 months now. The rates are usually better than P2P platforms I used to rely on (Binance, Kucoin, etc), and the peace of mind has honestly been worth more than anything. It‚Äôs called **Mular**, and it‚Äôs available on both the Google Play and Apple App Store. **To be clear‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt an ad.** I'm one of the co-founders, yes, but I‚Äôm also just a regular user who was tired of the usual P2P runaround. If you're curious, I‚Äôm happy to answer questions, share how it works, or point you to the app privately. **Why I‚Äôm Sharing This:** 1. **Transparency**: As a co-founder, I want honest feedback from real users 2. **Pain Points**: We built this specifically for Nigerian crypto users‚Äô needs 3. **Community**: I‚Äôm active here and happy to discuss crypto/fintech in Nigeria If you‚Äôve been looking for a smoother crypto-to-Naira solution, or have better ones you already use, feel free to drop your experience below too.

"My experience travelling to Lagos after a long while and with an expired passport I thought I would make this post to be helpful perhaps to others and to share my experience travelling to Lagos with an expired Nigerian passport. Context I hadn‚Äôt been back to Lagos in over 10 years, and I was a child when I last went. One of my parents is Nigerian, but I was raised in Europe. My primary reason for travelling was to reconnect with my cousins. However, I‚Äôd also been talking to someone romantically and thought this trip would be a great chance to meet them in person as well. \*Travelling\* I was able to board my flight using my expired Nigerian passport. For reference, I flew with Lufthansa, and the flight itself was smooth, with no delays. However, once I arrived at Nigerian immigration, the official seemed quite perturbed that my passport had been expired for so long (it had expired in 2014 lol). I did panic at first but I realised that the official was flirting with me and then he asked for my number. Once I gave it to him, he let me through without any issues. It was one of the odder encounters of my trip, but I soon realised that men in Nigeria tend to be much more forward. If they find you attractive, they won‚Äôt hesitate to let you know lol. If you‚Äôre a solo female traveler, be prepared for some unwanted attention at times. That said, I was able to retrieve my bags smoothly and headed to the pick-up area. On my way out, I was approached by several people offering their services, as is common at the airport. You don‚Äôt have to give them money, but some may assist you with a trolley for your bags and it is generally expected that you tip them. \*My experience of Nigeria in general as a woman travelling solo\* Having not been back to Nigeria for over a decade, my memories were faint. However, I noticed significant changes, especially at the airport, which was much more modern than I remembered. Overall, my experience as a woman traveling solo felt quite different this time around. One thing that stood out was the sheer amount of attention I received. It was a bit overwhelming for me, as men in Europe tend to be more reserved. I found it challenging sometimes to enjoy simple things like eating alone or spending time at bars because men were so forward. Although this was occasionally frustrating, I appreciated that Nigerians are generally very friendly, and the food I tried was amazing. I especially loved the fruits, they taste so different to fruit in Europe. Even something like a mango in Nigeria tastes vastly different to what I have consumed here in Europe. I did tire of the staples‚Äîswallow, shawarma, and rice seemed to be everywhere‚Äîbut I managed to find some unconventional dishes too. A highlight for me was discovering grilled catfish, which is now my absolute favourite! Another thing I noticed was how prevalent tipping and monetary expectations are. People often expect you to give them money, whether they‚Äôre helping you or not. They won‚Äôt force you, but the persistence can be exhausting. Thankfully, I‚Äôm naturally generous and tend to tip heavily, so I didn‚Äôt mind too much. Plus, seeing the gratitude and smiles from people was rewarding. Throughout my trip, I realised I often received preferential treatment‚Äîsomething I initially resisted acknowledging. For example, I was let through certain situations with ease, while others had a harder time. It was a bit surreal, but I suppose it‚Äôs part of the culture. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt feel unsafe or at risk of being kidnapped or harmed. As with any trip, it‚Äôs important to stay aware of your surroundings and keep your belongings close, but I wouldn‚Äôt say I felt in danger. \*Getting around & currency\* I used Bolt to get around and found it extremely easy to travel around Lagos with this app. While Uber is also available, I preferred Bolt because of the cheaper prices. Compared to euros, the cost of transportation was incredibly affordable, and I didn‚Äôt encounter any issues with taxi drivers. For payments, I used my Revolut card, and the exchange rate was quite favourable. Additionally, I was able to use some apps to transfer money to family members, who helped me get cash when needed. While I didn‚Äôt withdraw money at an ATM myself, I could have easily done so using my Revolut card. \*Passport\* I had arranged to renew my passport while in Nigeria, and one of my uncles helped facilitate the process. This made things much easier for me. I completed my biometric capturing in a single day and received my new passport three days later. If you can arrange this route, I highly recommend it. For context, renewing for a 10-year Nigerian passport in Europe can be expensive and sometimes unavailable due to stock issues. \*My experience departing\* Leaving Nigeria was a much more chaotic experience than arriving. At check-in, the staff were strict about weighing hand luggage. My hand luggage was several kilograms overweight, but the check-in official let me through, saying they liked me (yep, they literally said that lol). While I appreciated getting a pass, I‚Äôd advise others to be careful about packing, as it seems to me they are much stricter with luggage weight when departing Nigeria. In fact the guy in front of me was only over the limit by \~2 kg and they sent him to pay for the excess. Security, however, was the most stressful part of my departure. The personnel at the checkpoints were unprofessional and, frankly, inappropriate. While I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with a polite compliment, the soldiers at the checkpoint stopped me, asked silly questions, and also tried to flirt. By this point, I was done being polite and felt quietly frustrated. By the time I got to the boarding gate, I was genuinely anxious and just wanted to leave. \*Final thoughts\* Overall, my experience in Nigeria was a solid 8/10. The food, culture, and friendliness of the people made my trip enjoyable. It was also awesome seeing my cousins and also the dude I was talking to. However, the unprofessionalism and unwanted advances I encountered‚Äîparticularly at the airport‚Äîwere a 2/10. If you plan to visit, especially as a solo female traveler, just keep your wits about you and be prepared for some cultural differences. That said, I‚Äôm glad I went. It was a memorable trip, and I‚Äôd love to visit again in the future :) I will definitely be back. I hope this reassures anyone considering travelling solo- it really isn't bad at all! It can be a bit frustrating at times, but for me, the pros far outweighed the cons!",Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,6545

"I Traveled Out of Lagos for the First Time in Years, and I Got a Harsh Reality Check Last week, I traveled to Edo State for a wedding. It was my first time leaving Lagos in a very long time, and I was filled with so much excitement and happiness about the journey. In preparation, I downloaded movies on my phone and even packed my laptop, hoping to work remotely while I was there. However, to my surprise, when I arrived, the internet connection was so poor that I couldn‚Äôt get any work done. To make matters worse, there was no electricity. Thankfully, I was lodged in a hotel, but instead of the usual practice of switching to a generator during power outages, their main source of power was a small generator, limited because of the high cost of fuel. They also had an inverter powered by solar panels as a backup. This meant no air conditioning and no ironing; I had to make do with a fan. It was manageable, but far from what I expected. On the evening of the wedding day, curiosity got the better of me, and I asked why the electricity situation was so bad. I had already spent three days there without power, and it felt strange. To my shock, I was told there hadn't been light in the area for over a month. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. How is that even possible? One of the men I spoke to expressed his frustration, passionately ranting about how poorly electricity is distributed in the area and the many challenges that come with it. He spoke about how it had forced many young people to leave the rural parts of Edo State in search of better opportunities elsewhere. I could feel the pain and helplessness in his voice.

"Rewiring Nigeria: A Reflection on National Purpose and Governance I‚Äôve been thinking‚Ä¶ For a person to truly change, they often need to shift their mindset‚Äîreassess their beliefs, mental models, and the way they see life. Now imagine that on a national scale. Nigeria, like every country, also has a ‚Äúmind.‚Äù And that mind is our governance system‚Äîthe values, decisions, and leadership culture that shape everything else downstream. So I began asking: What would it take to truly rewire Nigeria‚Äôs governance? For me, real change only began when I paused and asked: **""Why am I here?""** That question gave me direction‚Äîand forced me to realign my actions with something deeper. As a country, maybe we need to ask the same: **Why do we exist?** And if we don‚Äôt know‚Äîor can‚Äôt agree‚Äîhow do we know we‚Äôre moving in the right direction?

I‚Äôm not as much anymore‚Äîbut since it runs deep in our culture, I‚Äôll share this: **‚ÄúWhere there is no vision, the people perish.‚Äù** ‚Äî Proverbs 29:18 **So I ask again:** What is our shared vision as a nation? Because if we don‚Äôt have one, we‚Äôre just moving in different directions‚Äîeach chasing survival, not progress. And even if we say we have a vision, but don‚Äôt truly invest in it‚Äî Then what‚Äôs the point? Either way, we‚Äôll end up nowhere. So how do we begin to bring every Nigerian under a shared vision‚Äîone that truly benefits all of us? A vision strong enough to shatter tribalism. To uproot corruption. To make accountability and transparency the norm‚Äînot the exception. From those fighting just to eat today, To those at the very top.",Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,1606
What was going on in Ibadan forest? Hi I am an American and was reading wanted to ask about the Ibadan forest case? Did something like this really happen I can't find anything on it besides vague assertions that the cities elites had something to do with it. Alongside apparently a second one being found in a neighbouring town? What the hell was going on is it true that these people were going to be murdered ritualistically? Has anyone been arrested for this? How is it treated in Nigeria if its even discussed? Sorry if this is the wrong space to share but I couldn't find much actual discussion about it from Nigeria and hoped this would be a good spot to ask.,Nigerian,reddit/Nigeria,665

"Justice for Hamdiya There are probably thousands of criminals roaming our streets, hundreds of non-state actors governing Nigeria‚Äôs ungoverned spaces, and countless others facing corruption and money laundering charges, including those at the helm of our affairs. Then there‚Äôs Hamdiya‚Äîa teenager whose only alleged crime is ‚Äúuse of insulting or abusive language‚Äù and ‚Äúinciting disturbance‚Äù for criticizing a governor. She‚Äôs been on trial, threatened repeatedly, and yesterday she was abducted. Today, she was found unconscious and dumped. She‚Äôs now in the hospital, fighting to recover. This is the cost of demanding good governance in Nigeria. It is heartbreaking to witness leaders, who are meant to protect their citizens, instead turn against them.

I‚Äôm doing research about our cultural origins and continuations in the West African region, specifically focusing on Nigeria (Benin, Togo and Ghana) at the moment. ‚Ä¢ Linguistics In the title I mentioned Nigerian Pidgin, because it‚Äôs an English-based Creole language on the continent of Africa closely resembling our English-based Creole in Suriname named ‚ÄúSranantongo, Sranan‚Äù. Sierra Leonean Krio has a very close resemblance to ours as well. The West African influences in our Creole are from Fon, Yoruba, Igbo, Akan (Twi & Fante), Ewe, Mina, Nago, Efik, Ibibio, Mende etc. So if you speak Nigerian Pidgin and/or any of these languages and would like to engage feel free. I‚Äôll show some comparative words and phrases between Sranan and ethnicities relevant to this Reddit to illustrate why I‚Äôm in this Reddit segment for my research.

Our Afro-Surinamese Spiritual system is called Winti. It didn‚Äôt syncretize with Christianity and remained fully African leaving us with a large pool of African cultural retention to research. Winti is also the name of our deities. Our equivalent of Vodun and Orishas. I‚Äôll list some of our Winti lexicon that align with Vodun and Orishas below.

Over the past few months, I‚Äôve made some significant improvements to the system, including: * Tone marks for the 10 tones * Vowel length markers * Diphthong and aspiration markers * New glyphs for sounds that weren‚Äôt well represented or weren‚Äôt represented at all, like B, Gb, Th, Dlu, Dlv, X, Die, Dli, Dlo, etc. I‚Äôve got the new glyphs ready in print form, and I‚Äôm currently working on a font that I hope to release in the next few months. This project is really personal for me. Not only do I want to help preserve the Cherokee language, but I also want to be inclusive. As more Cherokee Freedmen reconnect with our African roots‚Äîespecially Yoruba and Igbo‚Äîthere‚Äôs a growing need for a writing system that can reflect that. For example, many of us use the term ‚ÄúObu‚Äù (from Yoruba ‚ÄúOba‚Äù) as a term of endearment, and I want to make sure people can write those connections in the language too. I started this project when I was 10, got serious about it at 18, and now at 26, I‚Äôve put a lot of blood, sweat, and love into this work. Right now, around 100 people (besides myself and the project team) are using the script, and I‚Äôm hoping one day it will be officially adopted by the tribe, or at least recognized. But for now, I just want to get more people using it! I‚Äôm also working on a book that will explain how to use the system, and it will be available for $10. I‚Äôm planning to offer free group lessons and paid individual lessons soon as well. I‚Äôll share the details once everything is sorted out. Thanks so much for letting me share this with you all.

So, the play is in English but needs to be performed with a Nigerian accent. When casting, we tried to find folks who were already comfortable speaking a Nigerian dialect/accent but weren't very successful. Now we have half a cast that is totally uncomfortable doing an accent or even attempting one. Additionally, the cast members who can do an accent/dialect don't know how to give direction to the others who can't.

Honorific pronouns are respectful pronouns, Yor√πb√° does not indicate gender but we place emphasis on respect and this is where we make use of the Honorific pronoun. This is used when we are speaking to either an older person, plural or in polite conversation or formal conversation with someone. We have four of them 1. ·∫∏ - you (all). It is used with greetings, question markers and it is placed in the subject position, it comes before the verb. 2. Y√çN - YOU. (all). - It is used for possessive, it is placed in the object position after the verb. 3. W·ªçÃÅn (with the high tone ""m√≠""). - He/she/they 4. W·ªçn (with the flat tone ""re""). Him/her/them Let's look at some examples. 1. ·∫∏ k√°√†r·ªçÃÄ - Good morning 2. ·π¢√© ·∫π f·∫πÃÅ j·∫πun - Do you want to eat?. 3. Mo f√∫n y√≠n n√≠ ow√≥ - I gave you money. 4.

I'm writing MA thesis on the Polish translation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's ""Americanah"" and for the sake of data analysis I need to know the meaning of some Igbo excerpts that appear in the novel. I've done as much online research as I could but still there are some Igbo insertions I wasn't able to translate myself. Unfortunately, I don't know this language, so I would be truly grateful for any help from you. These are the Igbo parts the English meaning of which I want to ask you about: 1. ***kwa*** - this word appears several times throughout the novel in contexts like: ""Normal ***kwa***? It's not normal at all"" or ""Ugly, ***kwa***? What are you talking about?""; I assume this word is used to express disagreement or surprise, it that right? 2. ***o rika*** - this phrase appeared in the sentence: ""Thirty-five is too much, ***o rika***, biko"" 3. **rapuba** - as in a sentence: ""It will happen for you, don't worry, **rapuba**"" 4. ***shay*** - this one possibly comes from Nigerian Pidgin but, of course, correct me if I'm wrong; it was used in this context: ""Ifemelu did not have the heart to tell her that nobody said ""**shay**"" any more"" and from this I gathered that shay is a word popular among teenagers in Nigeria that after all became obsolete 5. ***sah*** - as in: ""I hope everything is fine, ***sah***"" And a few longer excerpts: 1. ***I maka.*** - (""You put on some weight and it suits you. ***I maka***."") 2. ***Ife esika kita***. - (""***Ife esika kita.*** The recession is biting everybody."") 3. ***I ga-askiwa***. - (""(‚Ä¶) but you Igbo people? ***I ga-askiwa.***"") 4. ***Aru adikwa***? - (""***Aru adikwa?***"" Obinze shrugged. ""I'm fine. Just tired."") 5. ***ma ife*** - (""Obinze ***ma ife***."" - here Obinze is the name of the protagonist) 6. ***Nwanyi oma, nwoke oma, omalicha nwa, ezigbo oyi m o.*** If any of you could provide me with an explanation of any of these words/phrases, I would appreciate it very much.
