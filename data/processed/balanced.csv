"Are decent Jamaican men back home interested in diaspora women? I am really interested to hear some thoughts on this? I am a 30 year old woman born in the UK. My Mum was born here and my pops was born in Jamaica. As many of you will understand, the more generations you are detached from your parents/grandparents country, the more removed you are from your culture. Personally I make an effort to go back to Jamaica on a yearly basis. Sometimes on a solo trip to visit family, sometimes girls trips to turn up or sometimes with my UK family. But I know deep down I would prefer a Jamaican partner. I want to start making an active effort towards settling down and in an ideal world I would settle down with a Jamaican born man. I want to settle back home in the future as I want my children to have strong ties to Jamaica. However I find it so hard to meet DECENT Jamaica born men in the UK. A lot of the ones I come across fit the ‚Äòyardie‚Äô stereotype and that‚Äôs not the kind of man I see myself with. I am thinking about taking dating seriously next time I‚Äôm in Jamaica and opening myself up to meeting new people. However I don‚Äôt know how us British diaspora women are perceived in Jamaica. I assume that people won‚Äôt take me seriously as there are so many beautiful educated women back home‚Ä¶and the ones who will take me seriously are probably looking a visa üò´ Has anyone had success living abroad and settling down with someone back home who has a good heart, is educated etc. How did you meet? Dating is hard enough already and I‚Äôm afraid my extra criteria‚Äôs just going to make it harder.",Jamaican

"Citizenship by descent - received passport, no certificate I applied for citizenship by descent at the NYC consulate in February and applied for my passport at the same time. In March, PICA said I needed to resubmit the second page of my passport application because my signatures didn‚Äôt match. I completed that in the same month. My Jamaican passport arrived this week but I haven‚Äôt received my citizenship certificate. I know you can‚Äôt be approved for a passport without first being a citizen, so I‚Äôm sure my citizenship was approved, but isn‚Äôt this a little backwards? Shouldn‚Äôt I have received the citizenship certificate by now? Do I have to contact PICA for a replacement? Thanks for your help!",Jamaican

"Impact of rainy season (Jun-Nov) on your physical wellbeing and cognitive performance (concentration, creativity) How do you experience the rain season in the Caribbean, between June and November? I have been several times in the Caribbean, but always December or April/May. Thus in the drier and less humid season, and no risk of heavy storms. Are there many of you residing in the Caribbean that stay during dry season (Dec-May) and leave elsewhere during rainy season? How do you experience the high humidity and heat from June to November on : physical fitness, ability to focus and work efficiently (computer/cognitive). Does the humidity and heat drain you and make you sleepy and less efficient cognitive wise? How often do you experience power cuts (no lights, no AC, no internet...) during rainy/stormy season? Thank you",Jamaican

"If you had the choice to raise your family in Aruba or Saint Martin, which place would you choose? We have the opportunity to move to the Caribbean. We're about to take a trip with our two toddlers to see which place would be the best fit for our family. Right now we're stuck between Saint Martin or Aruba. I'm personally drawn more to Saint Martin. I feel like it has so much to offer as far as adventure and things to do, and it's a short ferry ride to neighboring islands. I like that there's a variety of different cultures and that it has an inactive volcano. But, everyone we've talked to has praised Aruba over Saint Martin profusely. We've also seen a lot of people talk about how safe Aruba is compared to Saint Martin. Apparently the crime has gotten worse in Saint Martin in the last ten or so years and that part does concern me, especially with two toddler girls. So that is my only hang up. If you had the choice to raise your family in Aruba or Saint Martin/Sint Maarten, which place would you choose? Any help or input is appreciated.",Jamaican
"Is there a Caribbean destination that actually feels inclusive and not just touristy? I‚Äôve done the typical all-inclusive resort thing, and while it was fun, I‚Äôm looking for something deeper and more real. I want an experience that respects and celebrates Caribbean culture, especially places where solo travellers are welcome and safe. Some friends mentioned St. Croix and Curacao as more open-minded options, but I‚Äôd love to hear more. Are there small islands or beach towns where you get the music, the food, the dance, the history, all without being treated like just another tourist? Bonus if there are festivals or local events I could attend. I‚Äôm also into cannabis culture, so if that‚Äôs a thing in any of these places, I‚Äôd love the 411. Appreciate any first-hand experience. Not just looking for beach pics, I want soul.",Jamaican
"Justice for Jamaican women For the past few months stories of jamaican women, young girls and baby girls have headlines after they were unalived or graped. Just this past week a man was caught on video fighting a NURSE, throwing her to the ground and walking on her head in a road rage incident that he caused. A university student was recently kidnapped and has been missing. A 9 year old was unalived and graped by a man who had been in jail for breaking both arms of another young girl. Jamaican men view women as sex objects, tourists love the attention they're getting but they're enabling these professional harassers and predators. On estimate atleast 1 in every 10 women in Jamaica have experienced assault, harassment or kidnapping. How has this become such a norm?üòû JAMAICAN WOMEN ARE IN DANGER!",Jamaican

"Afro-Jamaican spirituality? Hey there. Please be patient with me, I am very new to this and not very educated. Recently I have felt a calling to explore different religions/spirituality. Both of my parents were born and raised in Jamaica, but moved to America to have me. I was raised super Christian, but would love to learn about African spirituality, specifically in Jamaica. My family is not open to discussing this with me, as they believe it is ‚Äúevil‚Äù. I‚Äôve particularly been interested in learning about Kumina, but there is such little information about it out there. I feel drawn to Jamaican history, as that is where my people come from, and I know very little about my ancestors. I just want to learn, and be less closed minded. Would you consider Kumina to be a ‚Äúreligion‚Äù? Is it something I can begin to practice at home? If so, what are some small spiritual things I can do to push me in the right direction? Is it like other African spiritualities, where I can get a ‚Äúreading‚Äù from a religious official? What deities are present in Kumina? How could I learn/connect more? Do you have any good resources for learning about Afro-Jamaican spirituality?? Any and all information is welcome! Thanks for reading, and thank you in advance.",Jamaican

"If All Politicians Are the Same, Why Bother to Vote?"" Here in Jamaica, we‚Äôve got two main political parties, and for many of us, it feels like both sides play the same game‚Äîpromises, problems, and little progress. It‚Äôs easy to ask: ‚ÄúIf nothing really changes, why should I vote?‚Äù But here‚Äôs the flip side: if you don‚Äôt vote, you lose your say. The people who show up to the polls are the ones shaping the future, even if it‚Äôs not the future you wanted. So what do we do when we feel politically stuck? Do we vote for the lesser evil? Do we demand better candidates? Do we spoil our ballots in protest? Do we organize beyond the ballot box? I‚Äôm genuinely curious: How do you handle political frustration in a system that feels broken? Especially for us here in JA‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the solution when both parties feel the same? Let‚Äôs talk.",Jamaican

"Caribbean Travel Advice My husband and I are planning our 20th anniversary trip, no kids.

We're open to all-inclusives or places that have food on-site. Happy to travel to local towns for excursions. We're looking at Jamaica, St. Maartin, Antigua so far.

"Are all/most Jamaicans pro weed? Okay so I know it‚Äôs obviously not gonna be all, but from what I‚Äôve seen off the internet, smoking ganja in Jamaica is very common and nobody really seems to care. But if so many people do it, why is it still so risky. Like, are there Jamaicans that would actually rat someone out for smoking ganja? Because in the USA, in the illegal states, there‚Äôs plenty of people who would call the cops on someone for smoking weed. What I‚Äôm basically asking is, is the stereotype that like pretty much all Jamaicans love ganja even true? What does Babylon think of ganja smokers, do they actually think it‚Äôs wrong and don‚Äôt smoke it themselves? From the way media makes it out to be in the USA, it just looks like everybody in Jamaica smokes ganja so it‚Äôs hard for me to even think that someone would call the cops or something over it.",Jamaican

"Best Caribbean island for 3 women in their mid 30's Hello we are 3 women in our 30's looking for a tropical destination within a 3-5 hour flight from NYC during June.

As we are not into group tours, we also want somewhere that is safe enough for us to wander and explore on our own (not planning to be wandering alone late night, but you get the idea). Budget is not an issue, lodging we really want adults only, or at least a spot not geared towards families/has designated adults only areas. Places we are considering, but open to others: Saint Lucia, Saint Barts, Saint Martin, Grenada, Turks and Caicos I have been to Aruba, Jamaica, The Bahamas, and Belize multiple times so no on those spots. Any help would be amazing as there are so many options, hard to narrow it down. EDIT: Thank you everyone for your input, it was much appreciated!

"Justice for Hamdiya There are probably thousands of criminals roaming our streets, hundreds of non-state actors governing Nigeria‚Äôs ungoverned spaces, and countless others facing corruption and money laundering charges, including those at the helm of our affairs.

She‚Äôs been on trial, threatened repeatedly, and yesterday she was abducted. Today, she was found unconscious and dumped. She‚Äôs now in the hospital, fighting to recover. This is the cost of demanding good governance in Nigeria. It is heartbreaking to witness leaders, who are meant to protect their citizens, instead turn against them.

"We really need to document our TFR and population properly. We are completely relying on foreign organizations for the data, and most of their figures are purely estimates. Nigeria's TFR in 2013 was estimated to be around 5.74 children per woman. This fell to around 4.48 in 2023, 10 years later. These are the figures from 2013‚Äì2023: 5.74, 5.66, 5.62, 5.58, 5.52, 5.45, 5.38, 5.31, 4.64, 4.48. This means that the total decrease over 10 years = 5.74 - 4.48 = 1.26, or an average of 0.126 per year. Here is the problem with this data: if you look closely, the TFR or at least the recorded TFR barely dropped over the years until the UNICEF MICS survey was conducted. Then it found that our TFR was significantly lower than what was actually recorded. To put this into context, if the rate of 0.126 per year is constant meaning that it doesn't drop or increase any faster‚Äîthis would be our TFR over the decades: * 2030s (average year 2035): 4.48 - (0.126 √ó 12) = 4.48 - 1.512 = 2.97 * 2040s (average year 2045): 2.97 - (0.126 √ó 10) = 2.97 - 1.26 = 1.71 * 2050s (average year 2055): 1.71 - (0.126 √ó 10) = 1.71 - 1.26 = 0.45 * 2060s (average year 2065): 0.45 - (0.126 √ó 10) = 0.45 - 1.26 = -0.81 (capped at 0, as TFR cannot be negative). What makes this even more concerning is that the Federal Government is incompetent and doesn't accurately record data, meaning that we have to rely on predictions and estimations from world organizations. For example, the prediction from the UN for 2023 was 4.48 children per woman, but that TFR is completely wrong since the TFR recorded by UNICEF during the MICS survey in 2021 was 4.6. We really need to be sure about this data, or we will face a massive crisis in the future one without any solution. The next MICS survey will be either this year or next year, and that will tell us how our TFR is doing whether it has stabilized or fallen even further. But if we see as big of a drop between 2021 and 2026 as we saw from 2017 to 2021, then the Federal Government will have to start taking immediate action. That would mean we will likely never reach 400 million in population, and that our demographic dividend is a lot closer than we ever thought.",Nigerian

Am I being overdramatic? So me and my father do not have a good relationship at all I hold a lot of resentment for him for the way he‚Äôs treated me and I fear him a lot bc he would beat me when I was younger as well as the fact he isn‚Äôt someone I feel I can really talk to about my problems because he often makes me feel bad about them such as I told him I‚Äôm doing a gap year to reapply to medicine and he first asked what would I do if I don‚Äôt get in the second time which I‚Äôve given some thought about ofc but wasn‚Äôt really hoping to hear that from him. If I‚Äôm being honest my resentment towards him stems from the beatings i received as a child which I do not believe was justified. My first memory of him was him scraping the flesh off my skin when I got a temporary tattoo from a yogurt maybe when I was 4 or 5. I told him this because he‚Äôs asked why I fear him now even though he doesn‚Äôt hit me anymore which I believe is because I now defend myself he said it‚Äôs discipline and that it‚Äôs legal. Please tell me if I‚Äôm being overdramatic about this bc ik it‚Äôs common in Nigeria culture to beat your kids but I wasn‚Äôt raised in Nigeria and i believe physical harm does no good however I‚Äôve seen other posts that say their father beat them and it made them respect him after awhile when they grew up my father said the same thing about his dad I‚Äôm 18 right now but I‚Äôm not feeling that way so I‚Äôd like to know other peoples opinions Edit: also I‚Äôd like to mention that whenever we get into arguments and I say nasty stuff he brings up that hes done everything for me raised me etc and that he doesn‚Äôt deserve this and because of this I often feel bad that I don‚Äôt like him that much,Nigerian

"My experience travelling to Lagos after a long while and with an expired passport I thought I would make this post to be helpful perhaps to others and to share my experience travelling to Lagos with an expired Nigerian passport. Context I hadn‚Äôt been back to Lagos in over 10 years, and I was a child when I last went. One of my parents is Nigerian, but I was raised in Europe. My primary reason for travelling was to reconnect with my cousins. However, I‚Äôd also been talking to someone romantically and thought this trip would be a great chance to meet them in person as well. \*Travelling\* I was able to board my flight using my expired Nigerian passport. For reference, I flew with Lufthansa, and the flight itself was smooth, with no delays. However, once I arrived at Nigerian immigration, the official seemed quite perturbed that my passport had been expired for so long (it had expired in 2014 lol). I did panic at first but I realised that the official was flirting with me and then he asked for my number. Once I gave it to him, he let me through without any issues. It was one of the odder encounters of my trip, but I soon realised that men in Nigeria tend to be much more forward. If they find you attractive, they won‚Äôt hesitate to let you know lol. If you‚Äôre a solo female traveler, be prepared for some unwanted attention at times. That said, I was able to retrieve my bags smoothly and headed to the pick-up area. On my way out, I was approached by several people offering their services, as is common at the airport. You don‚Äôt have to give them money, but some may assist you with a trolley for your bags and it is generally expected that you tip them. \*My experience of Nigeria in general as a woman travelling solo\* Having not been back to Nigeria for over a decade, my memories were faint. However, I noticed significant changes, especially at the airport, which was much more modern than I remembered. Overall, my experience as a woman traveling solo felt quite different this time around. One thing that stood out was the sheer amount of attention I received. It was a bit overwhelming for me, as men in Europe tend to be more reserved. I found it challenging sometimes to enjoy simple things like eating alone or spending time at bars because men were so forward. Although this was occasionally frustrating, I appreciated that Nigerians are generally very friendly, and the food I tried was amazing. I especially loved the fruits, they taste so different to fruit in Europe. Even something like a mango in Nigeria tastes vastly different to what I have consumed here in Europe. I did tire of the staples‚Äîswallow, shawarma, and rice seemed to be everywhere‚Äîbut I managed to find some unconventional dishes too. A highlight for me was discovering grilled catfish, which is now my absolute favourite! Another thing I noticed was how prevalent tipping and monetary expectations are. People often expect you to give them money, whether they‚Äôre helping you or not. They won‚Äôt force you, but the persistence can be exhausting. Thankfully, I‚Äôm naturally generous and tend to tip heavily, so I didn‚Äôt mind too much. Plus, seeing the gratitude and smiles from people was rewarding. Throughout my trip, I realised I often received preferential treatment‚Äîsomething I initially resisted acknowledging. For example, I was let through certain situations with ease, while others had a harder time. It was a bit surreal, but I suppose it‚Äôs part of the culture. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt feel unsafe or at risk of being kidnapped or harmed. As with any trip, it‚Äôs important to stay aware of your surroundings and keep your belongings close, but I wouldn‚Äôt say I felt in danger. \*Getting around & currency\* I used Bolt to get around and found it extremely easy to travel around Lagos with this app. While Uber is also available, I preferred Bolt because of the cheaper prices. Compared to euros, the cost of transportation was incredibly affordable, and I didn‚Äôt encounter any issues with taxi drivers. For payments, I used my Revolut card, and the exchange rate was quite favourable. Additionally, I was able to use some apps to transfer money to family members, who helped me get cash when needed. While I didn‚Äôt withdraw money at an ATM myself, I could have easily done so using my Revolut card. \*Passport\* I had arranged to renew my passport while in Nigeria, and one of my uncles helped facilitate the process. This made things much easier for me. I completed my biometric capturing in a single day and received my new passport three days later. If you can arrange this route, I highly recommend it. For context, renewing for a 10-year Nigerian passport in Europe can be expensive and sometimes unavailable due to stock issues. \*My experience departing\* Leaving Nigeria was a much more chaotic experience than arriving. At check-in, the staff were strict about weighing hand luggage. My hand luggage was several kilograms overweight, but the check-in official let me through, saying they liked me (yep, they literally said that lol). While I appreciated getting a pass, I‚Äôd advise others to be careful about packing, as it seems to me they are much stricter with luggage weight when departing Nigeria. In fact the guy in front of me was only over the limit by \~2 kg and they sent him to pay for the excess. Security, however, was the most stressful part of my departure. The personnel at the checkpoints were unprofessional and, frankly, inappropriate. While I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with a polite compliment, the soldiers at the checkpoint stopped me, asked silly questions, and also tried to flirt. By this point, I was done being polite and felt quietly frustrated. By the time I got to the boarding gate, I was genuinely anxious and just wanted to leave. \*Final thoughts\* Overall, my experience in Nigeria was a solid 8/10. The food, culture, and friendliness of the people made my trip enjoyable. It was also awesome seeing my cousins and also the dude I was talking to. However, the unprofessionalism and unwanted advances I encountered‚Äîparticularly at the airport‚Äîwere a 2/10. If you plan to visit, especially as a solo female traveler, just keep your wits about you and be prepared for some cultural differences. That said, I‚Äôm glad I went. It was a memorable trip, and I‚Äôd love to visit again in the future :) I will definitely be back. I hope this reassures anyone considering travelling solo- it really isn't bad at all! It can be a bit frustrating at times, but for me, the pros far outweighed the cons!",Nigerian

"Stop shipping back your kids I was sent to Ghana for nine years. And guess what? I still can‚Äôt speak my native tongue properly. I didn‚Äôt fit in there, and I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone. I was always a quiet kid, and everyone thought they could ‚Äúforce‚Äù the quietness out of me ‚Äî but it never worked. Maybe I‚Äôm neurodivergent, maybe I just didn‚Äôt fit in socially. But forcing me into an environment like that made it worse, not better. I stood out even after nine years. I never fully felt like I belonged there, and people could still tell I wasn‚Äôt originally from Ghana. So what exactly did it fix? Nothing. I‚Äôm not even saying you shouldn‚Äôt let your child learn about their roots ‚Äî of course it‚Äôs good for a child to understand their heritage. But please, do not confuse cultural exposure with punishment. You want them to connect with their identity? ‚Ä¢ Send them on holiday to visit family. ‚Ä¢ Let them stay for a year in a safe, loving environment ‚Äî not a strict institution. ‚Ä¢ Speak your native tongue to them at home. ‚Ä¢ Let them read books, watch African shows, talk to elders. ‚Ä¢ Actually educate them ‚Äî don‚Äôt abandon them. Because sending your kid straight from the UK to a boarding school in Africa ‚Äî especially when they didn‚Äôt see it coming ‚Äî is cruel. Some of those schools feel like prison camps. The caning, the early wake-ups, the isolation. It doesn‚Äôt build character. It breaks it. In my case, I wasn‚Äôt even misbehaving. It was just about ‚Äúlearning culture.‚Äù But nine years? You can‚Äôt tell me that‚Äôs necessary. They could‚Äôve cut it short. They could‚Äôve done better. So I‚Äôm saying this clearly: Stop sending your kids to boarding schools in Africa as a solution. Stop lying to them about it. Stop calling it ‚Äúdiscipline.‚Äù Stop using culture as a cover for cruelty. If your child is struggling with behavior or you‚Äôre scared they‚Äôre heading toward danger ‚Äî do your job as a parent. Get therapy. Talk to a school counselor. Go to youth support services. Involve junior police programs if you must. But do not abandon your child because parenting became hard. If you‚Äôre not ready to deal with the worst sides of parenting, you shouldn‚Äôt be a parent.

"Rome 2000 Years Ago vs Africa 'An Hour Ago' ‚Äì A Racist Meme or a Deeper Wake-Up Call? Came across this image on Facebook (attached) and was stunned by the layers of bias, ignorance, and blatant racism it represents. It shows a Roman building under the caption **‚ÄúRome: 2000 years ago‚Äù** and a traditional African hut captioned **‚ÄúAfrica: about an hour ago.‚Äù** Many of the comments under it ranged from anger to education to outright trolling. Some stood out for how deeply they captured the bigger picture: üîπ *‚ÄúThis refined form of racism makes me both angry and perplexed...

Or does it reflect a deeper global contempt for Africa that we‚Äôve internalized and failed to dismantle? Why are many so quick to forget the architectural, scientific, and cultural contributions of Africans - and the fact that this continent was looted, not lazy? Why do we let racist tropes circulate unchecked when the reality is that African cities have skyscrapers, smart tech, top universities, mining technologies, and billionaires?

"Justice for Hamdiya Reading about the recent kidnap and attempt ed murder of Hamdiya Sidi-Ali sent chills through my spine, a teenager going through such inhuman treatment because she dared to speak truth to power, betrayed by a governor whose responsibility it is to ensure the security of the lives and property of the good people of Sokoto state, betrayed by the police whose constitutional role it is to police the society and protect the citizens from any form of harm, betrayed by a society that won't stand up enmass against injustice. It's so painful that she and her loved ones alone had to go through this, the people she fights for do not know their left from their right, they all sit cowardly and watch while the ruling elites abuse power and pilfer the state's resources, and then, criticize the one who dared to speak up on behalf of the masses. Who are we exactly? This is just one case out of many, where some DISSIDENTS have been used as scape-goat to deter any form of accountability demand, by the leadership of this country. It however makes me wonder how much longer we would have to continue like this in a so-called democratic system. Our leaders believe in democracy when it comes to defending and protecting their rights to be in office, but when it comes to upholding the rule of law while discharging their constitutional role, they vehemently throw aside the democratic rhetorics, revealing the ugly dictator in them. Maybe the leadership is truly a reflection of who we are as a people, and perhaps right it is. Hamdiya got picked up, drugged, and left to die in an unknown location. Luckily for her, she was found and taken to the hospital. For what exactly?... Because she relentlessly, despite her haven being persecuted in the past, continued to criticize the leadership of Sokoto state, demanding for good governance to the people. If the people of Sokoto state still cannot see that their leadership is their true enemy by this acts, then they truly deserve the worst they're yet to experience. I just cannot fathom the rationale behind a seating governor using the instrument of the police and the judiciary to persecute a teenage girl. I'm so gutted right now, and wish for speedy justice for Hamdiya. I call upon the governor to append his resignation, the inspector general of police to punish and resind the batches of those police officers directly involved in this case. I call on the good people of Sokoto state, to rally enmass on the street of Sokoto shouting, raising placards, demanding for justice. This is not only about Hamdiya, it's a punitive call to end the persecution of people who criticize government. Nigerians need to start standing for each other against the true enemies of the state.",Nigerian

Outside of making all those men look weak, it‚Äôs undignified to carry around that belly in public. Ignoring the appearance, the cause is even worse. Men eating four meals or more in the day with each being full of oil, rice, and poultry. No nutrition, all fat, spice, and oil. Men with bellies like that are constantly looking for food all the time. No time to think about sharing the food available with others, no time to think about how much you‚Äôre eating, only time to gorge and drink.

"J K Rowling new fund, to waste Scottish tax payers money. So J.K. Rowling has set up the ‚ÄúJ.K. Rowling Women‚Äôs Fund‚Äù (JKRWF). She‚Äôs not accepting donations, because she‚Äôs bankrolling it herself. On the surface, it claims to protect ‚Äúsex-based rights,‚Äù but when you dig in, it‚Äôs very clearly about one thing: funding legal action to exclude trans women from public life especially places like schools, the NHS, and prisons. And guess who pays for all the fallout from that? Us, The Scottish taxpayer. The real cost of her court cases will be the Scottish tax payier. Her fund supports lawsuits and tribunal cases against public services places run with your tax money. Schools, hospitals, councils, women‚Äôs shelters, the police. Every time one of her cases goes to court, these institutions have to spend your money to defend themselves. If they lose, they pay damages and legal fees. If they win, they still burn through cash and time that should be going to actual services. She spends a few grand? We end up footing a bill in the hundreds of thousands. These lawsuits aren‚Äôt about protecting anyone. They‚Äôre about forcing public services to change policies that include trans people. That means expensive overhauls of staff training, signage, protocols more money wasted to appease a personal vendetta. And all while the NHS is on its knees, schools are underfunded, and councils are going bankrupt. But instead, she chose to create a legal fund targeting one of the most marginalised groups in society. Trans people especially trans women ,are already at greater risk of homelessness, violence, and suicide. This fund makes all of that worse. Nobody voted for this. It‚Äôs not protecting women, it‚Äôs fuelling a media-frenzied culture war that‚Äôs actively harming people.

While I'm not Scottish, as I don't live there, contribute to the economy, or vote in Scotland or the UK, I have a deep appreciation for your country and a genuine curiosity about its cultures, particularly right now regarding the sport of camanachd. I‚Äôm interested in exploring the prevalence of this sport below the Highland Line. Is camanachd taught and played in schools in those areas below the line? Have you played? What was your experience like? Additionally, I'm curious about the accessibility of the sport. How easy is it to find pick-up games or community events for those interested in playing in urban areas? For individuals who are passionate about camanachd, how inclusive is the community for players below the Highland Line? I think camanachd is a thrilling game to watch, and it seems equally exciting to play. Documentaries have highlighted its significance in the Highlands and Islands, showcasing how it fosters extremely deep community bonds and camaraderie among participants and fans. It appears to serve as a positive outlet for youth and adults, offering an alternative to challenges such as alcoholism, substance abuse and mental health struggles, which can be prevalent in some highland areas. I'm also pondering whether the lack of abundant positive opportunities for youth in the Highlands has contributed to camanachd becoming a central element of community life, or if it always has been. Furthermore, in regions where camanachd may not be as prevalent, does football fill that role instead? I would love and appreciate to hear more about the community dynamics, the growth of camanachd in various regions to the south, and how it compares to other sports in terms of engagement and support.

Over vapes - seriously? 'I don't know what we'll do' - Vapers panic-buy ahead of disposables ban‚Äù Continues to spout the line it‚Äôs a quitting aid - yet kids who have never touched a cigarette now do it. Says they are a quitting aid - yet come in flavours. Spout the lines from tobacco companies practically word for word - yet claim they are making an informed decision.

It may come as a shock to the subject of the article - but she won‚Äôt cease to exist after those vapes run out. Given there is still reusable on the market.,Scottish

"Shared Boundary Fence - Troubles with Neighbour Hello! Seeking some (potential) legal advice/understanding. On the deeds to our land it states that the boundary fence between ours and the neighbours is mutually owned, with maintenance to be carried out by both parties. (From my understanding, common in Scots Law). The owners of the house don‚Äôt live there, they instead rent it out to tenants. During the big storms in February the fence slats (not the posts) had came down, and we had repaired the fence and ensured it was still standing. The fence generally was in quite a poor state of disrepair, we have only owned the property for two years, and it was/has been in this state since we took ownership. The only maintenance the owners of the adjacent land claim to undertake is painting it on their side (we‚Äôve never seen them at the house before). The tenants over the last month/months had moved out, and we have seen essentially nobody coming and going to the property during this time. We had plans to remove the fence and replace it with a fence which was more sturdy, in better condition, and taller (still under the 2m height). Because the house had sat empty for a number of weeks we took the decision to take down the fence slats and put up a new fence. We haven‚Äôt removed the existing posts, and instead the new posts were fixed more clearly in our side of the boundary line - this was not for any intention other than avoiding tree roots which had taken root and made putting posts in on the actual boundary line very difficult. So the boundary/shared fence still has posts, and the new posts are firmly in our land. The slats were completely and utterly rotten, poorly maintained, and crumbling apart - there was no possible way they could be salvaged. We would have liked the chance to let them know of our plans, but with no way to get in contact with them, and the fear of the fence potentially coming down again and injuring our dog, we took the decision to just do the upgrade. We mistakenly thought they‚Äôd appreciate a new, higher quality fence that they didn‚Äôt have to pay a penny for. They‚Äôve shown up recently to do garden maintenance for their next tenant to take the lease, and have taken umbrage against us for having taken down the shared fence and are threatening that we return it (impossible due to the condition) or build a new shared fence on the boundary line. Are we in hot water here?",Scottish

"Why are hospitality venue owners so stubborn/small/backwards/stuck in the past thinking? I recently completed a 3 night trial at a venue in a capital city.

"Private health ins for kids with autism? I‚Äôm doing a bit of legwork on behalf of a friend with limited English. Long story short he has a 3 year old son who is likely to be diagnosed with fairly severe autism (once he can get in to see a specialist). I understand most preexisting conditions require a 12 month waiting period and thats fine, but I‚Äôm having trouble identifying policies that cover things like speech therapy and other development related Family has a fair number of other ongoing medical issues, so good private coverage is probably best in any event (even though they are well below the levy threshold) as public appointments are rare as hen‚Äôs teeth where we are. Does anyone have experience and have recommendations for solid private coverage, with an emphasis on the aspects mentioned above? Thank you! Edit: i should mention that he‚Äôs also pursuing ndis as well, but what a fucking labyrinth that is. It‚Äôs hard to keep everything straight as he‚Äôs been sent to so many places but the latest word is that the only places he can get in to get ndis diagnosis in a relatively short period of time are gojng to be private. He will do what he must to pay for it in the short term, but as his son will likely require long term treatment, i was thinking private insurance might‚Äîin this instance‚Äîpay off. He does have centrelink cards, etc. If that changes anything. EDIT EDIT: dear all, thank you SO MUCH for the advice and insight. I really appreciate it.

"Why are hospitality venue owners so stubborn/small/backwards/stuck in the past thinking? I recently completed a 3 night trial at a venue in a capital city. During the interview I was told ¬∑ the venue was 4 stories high (3 active floors and a basement used for private functions, weeknights and spillover) ¬∑ That ownership has 4 venues ¬∑ It‚Äôs a party (owners favourite word) venue ¬∑ The management structure is venue manager, assistant venue manager, supervisors (up to 4) ¬∑ Management (all levels) should be on the floor as much as possible and rarely in the office ¬∑ Ownership has been collecting data on patronage, volume of sales, volume of drinks per patron etc and developed KPIs to match for each night ¬∑ A whiskey bar with over 30 whiskeys and other spirits (advertised on website) When in reality ¬∑ The venue is currently only operating the basement room (which is a dark, dingy, dungeon like space without any of the cool dungeon appeal) ¬∑ Its actually 2 venues ¬∑ The atmosphere does not lend itself to ‚Äòparty‚Äô ¬∑ There is no assistant venue manager, just VM and the sole supervisor role I am doing a trial for ¬∑ The VM spends half of the night in the office uploading data into the system for ownership to keep track of ‚Äì including how many promo cards are handing out on the street vs handed in at the door for discounted entry (which is fine) ‚Äì but to be physically uploaded as data into the system every hour ¬∑ The KPIs are measured down the person per hour as expectations (in attendance and then spending volume) ‚Äì the VM seemed under immense stress to hit ‚Äòtargets/projections‚Äô (not enough people coming through the door was apparently the fault of the promo people in the street, once inside not enough spend per patron was management and bars fault) ¬∑ Bar staff are encouraged to try upsell patrons drink order towards a more expensive drink (I believe you do that maybe once on their first drink, but as a bartender you get what someone wants, you do not tell them what they want) ‚Äì also to move patrons on from beer to spirits as soon as possible as the profit margin is higher and also alcohol to get them to spend more money ¬∑ Was told point blank by manager of other venue while discussing ideas to improve business that ‚Äòyou keep them to yourself for at least 6 months, ownership doesn‚Äôt want to hear it‚Äô ¬∑ Whiskey bar is part of the venue not being used ‚Äì but none of the drinks made their way down to the 1 bar still in use ¬∑ There is no active social media ¬∑ And the bit that got me undone ‚Äì health and safety out the window ‚Äì I had to mop up a scene after a guy in a wheelchair was forced to urinate on the floor in the space before the toilets because there was no ramp to allow wheelchair access over the 3 stairs (heritage listed buildings don‚Äôt have to comply with disability access, but no access to toilets is a step to far for me that is discrimination) ‚Äì but no wet floor signs, no gloves the next night for a staff member to clean up spew in a basin, no rubber mats on the floor behind the bar, rips in the carpet that catch shoes and the feet of barstools, steps that are unlit and trip hazards) and staff and patrons openly vaping in the venue despite it being completely against the law - and me being the arsehole for telling people to stop it. At the end of the trial (so around 4am on the Sunday morning) I was offered the supervisor role by the VM but expressed concerns regarding the operations of the business and particularly the lack of health and safety practices, and said I had to think about it, but would be likely back as I feel I can make a difference. I received a phone call around 6pm that Sunday night telling me I was not required as there were ‚Äòother trials‚Äô being conducted. I texted the General Manager (who had been my contact) asking if matter could be discussed, the reply was ‚ÄòYou are not the right fit‚Äô and they are currently readvertising. Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt the first venue I have been at where ownership seems to only care about their own profit regardless of anything else (and if business isn‚Äôt doing well then cut corners and blame staff) and their own ego (and definitely not being challenged). I might be a bit old school ‚Äì but I believe that profits will come if you earn them ‚Äì ie, good product, good service, happy customers, good advertising (which is basically free in a social media age, if you do it), reputations (this venues one is down the drain I was told on the street) and the ability to keep staff instead of advertising constantly. It shouldn't feel like an episode of Kitchen Nightmares with Gordon Ramsay where everyone, but the owner knows what is wrong with the business and generally agrees how to improve it (and wants too), but ownership refuses to change and just blames the staff and customers. But, I guess that is why I am not an owner.. or in this case a supervisor any more either - have a feeling I am not the only hospo worker in the same situation",Australian

"Rules of the mountain If you hike where the fog clings low to the pine, And the wind through the holler hums mournful in time, Then heed what the old ones have carved into lore, Or you won‚Äôt leave the woods like you‚Äôve left them before. When daylight is dying, be back in your bed, For the dusk wakes the ones that remember the dead. Don‚Äôt open for knocking, don‚Äôt answer your name, If it stands on two legs but don‚Äôt move the same. If you hear a soft song where no singer should be, Keep walking and humming, eyes down, don‚Äôt you dare see. Leave bread on the stump if you‚Äôve borrowed the trail, Or the Little Ones curse you with more than just ail. Don‚Äôt wave at the figure who waits in the field, It knows you‚Äôve now seen it and won‚Äôt stay concealed. Don‚Äôt speak of the thing that you glimpsed in the trees, What‚Äôs named becomes real, and it‚Äôll find you with ease. If silence falls sudden, then hush every breath, For the quiet in woods is the herald of death. Three pennies at crossroads, don‚Äôt ask, just obey, Or you‚Äôll owe a fare that you can‚Äôt ever pay. Don‚Äôt cut at the oak with a face in the bark, Its roots run through bones buried deep in the dark. If a man joins your fire and don‚Äôt meet your gaze, Offer food, speak no questions, and part ways with praise. Don‚Äôt fish past the hour when the moon‚Äôs at its height, What bites past that mark drags you down out of sight. Mark ash on your door come the coldest of nights, To ward off the shadows that dance without light. If you wake up with dirt on the soles of your feet, Say thanks and lie down, don‚Äôt recall, don‚Äôt repeat. And pray, not the way that the preacher man said, But the tongue of your grandma, who speaks to the dead.",Southern US
"I posted this on tiktok and made a lot of folks mad I'm angry and sad about the entire situation. So many lives lost that could have been prevented. I know, in a perfect world my state wouldn't have voted this way. But I think there is a certain nuance to situations like these that folks who don't live in Appalachia don't understand. I think it comes with so much prejudice towards poor folks that has been hammered into Americans for so long. Folks don't want to acknowledge that there's a system in place keeping the poor down. Keeping education, healthcare, and basic necessities a luxury, so that they keep voting against their own interests. I don't think these folks can comprehend a life where you have to chose between working as a kid to provide for your siblings or going to school. I don't think they can comprehend what it might be like to not be able to read or write as an adult. Kentucky has 37.5% of adults reading between a 3rd and 8th grade level. I don't think they can comprehend that some folks don't even have access to reliable Internet. I see folks making comparison to the LA wildfires and saying they are just ""giving it back"" because folks were saying it was God's judgement to California. That shit wasn't right in the slightest, but you know what the difference is? A lot of folks in LA are wealthy and have somewhere to go. We heard about it for months. There were fundraisers hosted by the NFL and celebrities, but this will be lost in the news cycle within the next couple of days. I see a lot of similarities between this and hurricane Katrina. A lot of those victims were simply forgotten and blamed because they were poor and lived in a red state. But they didn't deserve it. They didn't vote for that. Sorry for the long rant but I long for the day when folks can see Appalachia for the beautiful and complex place that it is, instead of using it as a scapegoat to ignore their own prejudice and hate towards the less fortunate and disenfranchised. I know there are many hateful Appalachians but like everywhere in the world the good folks always outweigh the bad. The revolution is going to have folks from all walks of life.

You don‚Äôt get to separate Harvard from Texas when international education is the \*bridge\* between them. *Texas Tech Taught Me That Diversity Isn‚Äôt Cosmetic* When I was a student at Texas Tech, I saw firsthand the power of a diverse faculty and student body. It wasn‚Äôt political. It was \*effective.\* I learned from professors from India, Egypt, Korea, Nigeria, and Brazil. I worked on projects with students from Uzbekistan and Colombia. We didn‚Äôt sit around singing Kumbaya. We solved problems. We debated ideas. We competed and collaborated and made each other sharper. That‚Äôs the global university. Not a ‚Äúwoke‚Äù fantasy. A working engine. And now, the same federal officials who claim to champion innovation want to strip that engine for parts‚Äîbecause they don‚Äôt like what a few students believe? Because they think fear will keep us safe? *This Is About Control, Not Security* Let‚Äôs not be coy. This isn‚Äôt about national security. It‚Äôs about narrative control. It‚Äôs about telling public universities, ‚ÄúYou can have federal funding, but only if you help us police your students.‚Äù It‚Äôs about turning faculty into informants. About chilling research. About reminding anyone with a visa that their presence is conditional‚Äîfragile, revocable, and watched. But if public universities comply with this logic, they will cease to be public in any meaningful way. They‚Äôll become gatekeepers of obedience, not gateways to knowledge. *We Don‚Äôt Scatter. We Turn.* This is not a time to stay quiet, and it‚Äôs not a time to pretend this only affects the coasts. If Texas A&M, Texas Tech, UTHealth‚Äîand institutions like them‚Äîstand together, then the herd won‚Äôt scatter. It will \*pivot.\* And when it does, the people lighting firecrackers in D.C. will realize they were never holding a gun. They were just holding a match in a dry season. If you're reading this and thinking, ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt concern me,‚Äù think again. If you live in Texas and you‚Äôve ever been treated in a hospital, driven through a college town, or sent a kid to a public university‚Äîthen this isn‚Äôt about someone else. It‚Äôs about you.

"Bill: HB 3749 Afternoon y‚Äôall, Paramedics in Texas need your help. Currently there is a bill in the Texas senate regarding MedSpas and IV hydration business. As the bill currently stands, it would prohibit trained paramedics from administering IV therapy under a physicians orders in a clinic setting. Many of us work part time at some form of IV hydration business to make ends meet, as working on an ambulance or hospital is draining on our mental health. As paramedics, we routinely start IVs in people‚Äôs homes, on roadways after a vehicle accident, or any other emergency setting. We are extensively trained in IVs, cardiology, pharmacology, intubation, and patient assessment. If we are trusted to respond to an emergency and provide life saving treatments, why are we being excluded from providing basic IV hydration in a controlled clinical setting? I am asking for your support to amend HB 3749 by calling or emailing your state representatives to include paramedics so we may continue to provide safe and quality services to those who may seek them.",Southern US

"Turns to you Appalachia, stoic, old, and deep, Where shadows lengthen as the sunbeams creep Through ancient forests, hemlock, pine, and oak, And silence settles, save for crow's harsh croak. I've walked your paths, where laurel thickets bind, A solitary journey, peace to find. Your granite bones, unyielding to the frost, Hold tales of lives, both lived and truly lost. A Shiver in the Pines Yet sometimes, in the hollows, still and gray, A chilling quiet steals the breath away. A sudden gust, where no wind ought to be, Stirs phantom leaves upon a ghostly tree. The whispers travel on the mountain air, Of old, forgotten things, beyond compare To the mortal senses, a flicker in the eye, A sense of someone watching, passing by. The mists that cling, a comfort and a shroud, Obscuring peaks that pierce the passing cloud, They whisper secrets to the listening ear, Of time unhurried, banishing all fear. No grand display, no sharp, dramatic peak, But rolling grandeur, humble, strong, and meek. A steadfast presence, comforting and true, My heart, old mountains, ever turns to you.",Southern US

STAAR isn‚Äôt fairness it‚Äôs a double standard.

"Texas AG Ken Paxton Can Access Your Prescription Records >PDMP datasets typically include patient details, medication dosages, refill schedules, and identifying information for the prescriber and pharmacy. In nine states, the PDMP entry even contains the diagnosis code (ICD-10) associated with the prescription. That means a police officer scrutinizing the file could directly see why a person was prescribed a drug. In states like Tennessee or Florida, which track diagnoses, a record showing testosterone cypionate accompanied by an ICD code for ‚Äúgender dysphoria‚Äù would immediately telegraph that the patient is transgender. >As is often the case with law enforcement surveillance tools, PDMPs have proven susceptible to mission creep, Oliva writes, noting that most state programs now track not only opioids but ‚Äúall controlled substances as well as non-controlled ‚Äòdrugs of concern.‚Äô‚Äù In other words, a system built to catch illicit OxyContin refills has quietly become a mechanism to monitor any number of treatments ‚Äì from anxiety medications and stimulants for the treatment of ADHD to testosterone for gender transition. >Crucially, this vast trove of prescription records exists in a legal gray zone outside standard medical privacy protections. The questions about HIPAA compliance typically come up when I've discussed this subject. However, once a pharmacy uploads your data to a PDMP, that information is no longer covered by HIPAA privacy rules. Instead, each state dictates who can access the PDMP and for what purpose. Unfortunately, law enforcement agencies have lobbied hard for access. >Today, every state allows police or prosecutors to retrieve PDMP data, often without so much as a warrant. In many jurisdictions, all it takes is an administrative request or subpoena to sift through a person‚Äôs prescription history. Some PDMPs even generate unsolicited alerts such as if the software‚Äôs algorithms deem someone‚Äôs prescribing or usage ‚Äúsuspicious,‚Äù it can automatically tip off law enforcement. [...] >In their quest to create a gender bureaucracy to police the lives of transgender people, the anti-trans side is on board with the creation of an Orwellian surveillance state that tracks everyone's prescriptions. >Given how much more prevalent hormone prescriptions are among the cisgender population, any attempt to police and surveil transgender people's prescriptions will inevitably catch orders of magnitude more cis people in the surveillance dragnet. But that's entirely the intention. In this situation, it's become explicitly clear that transgender people are a mere pretext to enable a mass surveillance system to gain control over everyone's bodies and what prescriptions they are able to take. Ken Paxton and his cronies can access your prescription records, even if you don't live in Texas. It's a system so ripe for abuse, that it ultimately must be dismantled.",Southern US

"Appalachian Outlaw In-between hills, where shadows softly creep, Where the law‚Äôs thin hand could barely keep, We did what we must, with hearts both bold and deep, Just to keep our hungry kin from silent weep. They talk now loud, but their knowing is asleep, unaware of all the secrets mountains keep. I used to run shine where the wild winds blow, Through the mountain pass, with a fiery glow, Boot on the gas, pushing hard and low, Law on my back, a hunter I outgrow. Copper stills hiss, a whispered, heated show, Mama prayed hard, for the seeds we‚Äôd sow. Taught by my old man, whose heart held ember's heat, Taught me the craft, said ""never retreat."" Scars on my hands, a story incomplete. Fed dogs bark, a sound that can‚Äôt defeat, I walk right past, on silent, knowing feet. In these parts, where loyalties run neat, I‚Äôm like a blade of grass, in fields of summer wheat. Took my lumps hard, But my spirit stayed complete. Even when they came, with badges sharp and neat, I never cracked, just vanished in the lush green. Took my time, till setting of the sun, Never said a thing, till the hard-won race was run. Pour one out slow, For the ones who faught hard, 'til life‚Äôs thread was spun, Outlaws never fold but we carry heavy hearts when all is said and done. They called me criminal, with voices sharp and mean, Said I‚Äôd surely burn, in fires yet unseen. But the judge don‚Äôt know, how the cold nights intervene, When your kin got mouths, and your gut feels gaunt and lean. You do what you must, a path you must convene, Don‚Äôt care what it takes, though the consequences mean. If I fall, bury me, where mossy stones convene, Down by the creek, where the water flows serene. Seen more war in these woods, than their sheltered City eyes have gleaned, I lost blood and good friends, to the lead that intervened. Some to the feds, their wicked plots well-screened, Some to the way of life, a bitter fate uncleaned. But I never did fold, my purpose ever keen, Never lost my nerve, In any harsh ravine. I'm no saint, that much is plain to see, Never claimed that crown, for a sinner such as me. Never backed down, when trouble came so free, Put my truth in the jar, for all the world to heed. My son, the next young soul, beneath the old oak tree, Taught the family code, for all eternity. So if they speak of me, let their voices all agree, I was ten toes deep in mountain smoke, wild and free. my legend walks, where the honeysuckle clings, Through every trail and song the robin sings. Kept my kin fed, when the dinner bell would ring, And I fought the law, Buried many badges deep, And I Dug my own, when my end was soon to be, A life lived hard, in this Appalachian outlaw scene.",Southern US

"Endurance A hushed rumble, then a groan, The Earth itself, a battle zone. Two giants rose in ancient days, To stake their claim, in mountain ways.

With granite might, I touch the stars, Bearing scars of primal wars. My snow-capped crowns, they gleam and shine, A testament to power divine. Rivers rush from my high embrace, I carve the canyons, set the pace Bow down now and pass the crown!"" The Appalachians, soft and low, Replied with wisdom, alm and slow: ""Young upstart, boasting of height, You know not age, nor weathered light. I‚Äôve seen eons, watched them turn, Felt glaciers grind, and forests burn. My rounded shoulders, green and deep, Hold secrets while the young ones sleep. For I have stood, through ages vast, Where sharper peaks could never last. My ancient roots, they hold the ground, Where life in countless forms is found. Though gentle now, my spirit‚Äôs keen, A tapestry of evergreen. You boast of youth, and sudden rise, But I have witnessed timeless skies. Your jagged edges, they will wear, While I endure, beyond compare. For strength is not in height alone, But in the long-held, solid stone. I am the bedrock, old and true, And I, young friend, Will outlast you."" A silence fell, the wind did sigh, As clouds moved slowly through the sky. The Rockies, for a moment, bowed, Their youthful boasts, now unavowed.
