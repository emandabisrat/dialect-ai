"Scottish MSc vs American MA/moving abroad after graduation Hi everyone! I am currently studying abroad at UofG and I love it so much that I am looking at it for next year when I go to graduate school. I graduate from a university in Washington, D.C. with a degree in Political Science and Economics, i have a decently stacked resume with unique experiences and internships/extracurriculars. My GPA could be higher IMO but I went through some significant personal strifes in my undergrad so I think I could write a letter explaining that. Anyway, I've fallen in love with Glasgow and the University, and on top of that, UGlasgow's Masters in Political Communication is only one full year vs a two year MA in Political Communication at schools I'm looking at in DC. UG is also significantly cheaper even with USD conversion, without scholarships/aid I would be saving about 80k. It's also a MSc which is interesting because most schools I'm looking at in the States are only an MA-- so my question is \*\*is there a significant difference between these that would lead me to choose one over the other? What are upsides and downsides to getting an international Masters vs a States masters if my long-term goal is to stay in the States after my graduation? (\*\*I would try to go for the skilled visa/graduate visa after graduation and try to live in Scotland if I go to UofG but I heard this is somewhat difficult rn, can someone clarify this as well?) UofG is an internationally recognized school but I dont know if that would be as competitive on an American resume as say, Georgetown would. (but GT and DC are also way more expensive\*\*). If anyone has experience with a MSc or MA in Political Communication/is an American master's student at UofG or someone who moved to Scotland abroad could clarify or offer their experience, that would be most wonderful",Scottish

Dumgal Council Since when has it become council policy that large numbers of departments refuse to speak to residents. You are required to email in questions which they totally ignore or don’t answer correctly as they don’t understand the question asked as it can be out the scope of their generic forms.

"Half-Scottish, Half-English identity crisis. I was born in Scotland and lived there until I was 8, then moved down to England, I moved back up to Scotland 4 years ago, so technically most my life I've lived in Scotland. My dad is Scottish and my mum is English, and especially on my dad's side it's always felt like he's trying to get me to 'choose a side'. I have a neutral accent (sounds almost south-african), from living in other countries on and off, so that doesn't decide anything. And i'm also wondering if I have to even choose a side. It feels like I do when i'm living here, I often get asked 'which more do I feel', and I honestly have absolutely no idea. I've never thought of it as much of a big deal, almost to the point I feel neither Scottish or English. I'm making this post because I was at the pub the other day and a guy asked where I was from and I told him I had grown up in England but was half-Scottish, and he told me to my face I wasn't Scottish at all, which stinged a little bit to be honest. I have no views on the politics side of things, Scottish independence is something you'll have to ask someone else about, I'm not educated enough on it to form a coherent opinion. What I do know is I love Scotland and I love England, I've made so many beautiful memories in both of them, and wouldn't give up one over the other - however in a country(s) where the line is drawn so boldly, it's hard to feel like I belong to both of them.",Scottish
"Today MSP Ash Regan will introduce a bill to partially criminalise sex work (Nordic Model) And here's a trash tabloid article too in support of the law, where Ash refers to sex workers as ""pizzas"": If anyone wants to write to their MSP about it remind them the Nordic Model is strongly opposed by Amnesty International, The World Health Org, Human Rights Watch, Anti-Slavery International, Global Alliance against Traffic in Women, UNAIDS & UNFPA, Freedom United (anti-trafficking org), PICUM (Dutch based org concerned with the rights and safety of migrants in Europe), GAATW (The Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women), HIV Scotland, STOPAIDS, sex worker orgs and the Royal College of Nursing amongst others. Supporters for the bill include the churches and Marion Millar's gender critical org For Women Scotland. This includes Scotland for Decrim an org made of sex workers campaigning against the bill: Show them the open letter they signed too which gives good points (increased violence against sex workers (if clients are going to be violent they aren't going to be deterred by a law on paying for sex), sex workers and clients taking steps to avoid being caught such as not carrying condoms and meeting in more secluded locations, very difficult to enforce as sex workers are unwilling to testify). In Sweden there were only 2 convictions in the first 2000 arrests and only because they confessed and in N.Ireland which passed the Nordic Model in 2015 there has been 1 client arrest. Nordic Model countries arrest and convict more sex workers for working together than they do clients (the claim the NM ""decrminalises"" sex workers is very inaccurate).",Scottish

"traditional Scottish clothing for women Hi everyone! I've watched a lot of videos from tiktok and from my Norwegian bf about the 17th of May (Norway's national day) and been seeing all of the beautiful cultural dresses that Norwegian women wear, and it's got me thinking that for us in Scotland, a country with such rich history and culture, that our traditional clothing, especially for women, is so... non existent?? Whenever I google it, all that comes up is a mix of halloween costume polyester renaissance fair crap, which I have a hard time believing is anything close to accurate. I have come across a very few articles that discuss women's cultural clothing, but for the most part they all come to the conclusion of ""we don't really know what cultural clothing looked like for women with any great certainty"". There is the arisaid, but the few descriptions of this that exist seem to vary a lot depending on area and time, leading to no continuous cultural significance (in my eyes anyway). There's also discourse amongst academics and professionals over how accurate these descriptions even are. There are Scottish tartan businesses that make clothes in tartan patterns - but these aren't cultural in the same way so many other countries wear their traditional clothing. They're just regular clothes in tartan. Anyway, I guess I'm just curious about what all of you think about this? Can we make a pact to create and actual traditional dress for Scottish women that doesn't feed into all the Braveheart fantasy shenanigans? Please? Or maybe I just need to stop googling stuff heheh edit: through all of this googling I've also learnt that whilst tartan has been found in scotland for a long time, the association of tartan to different Clans is largely based on the romanticisation of the Highlands, and the regional differences in tartan is mostly down to different manufacturers in different areas coming up with their own designs. Also the modern kilt being a victorian take on the old ""Great Kilt"" :/ also the thing about the pact was mostly a joke, I'm just ranting about how I wish we had more options on par to other countries",Scottish

I don't have kids so I'm struggling a bit for ideas!

However, most of those bills won’t become law. Lawmakers will spend the final weeks before the session ends on June 2 trying to push through their priorities. They will also try to stop certain bills from going through by delaying votes and letting them miss key deadlines. If a bill fails, it might still be revived as an amendment to other legislation.

"Soup beans (pintos) with mayonnaise. Last night's post and conversation about food really got me feeling sentimental. I was talking to my husband about some of the things I ate growing up, that he had absolutely no concept of. One of them was soup beans with a dollop of mayo. Then we'd mix the mayo in to make kind of a creamy sauce. It was delicious, and for the longest time, the only way I'd ever eat mayo. My pappaw would always have a glass of buttermilk, but I just wanted ""sweet milk."" He also had to have cornbread with his beans, but I preferred mine straight up. So after this conversation, I was really craving this meal that I'd not eaten in decades. I didn't have any dried beans, but I did heat up a can of pintos and then dropped in a spoonful of Duke's. Then I poured a cold glass of milk, and that mix of textures, flavors and memories was just heavenly. My parents only ever used JFG mayonnaise, and I think Dad still does. I grew up in Upper East TN, so JFG was relatively ""local"", being from Knoxville, but I'm wondering how many other people had that in their fridge? Anyway - just musing, but thanks for the conversation and space to share these thoughts.",Southern US

Look at that prestine block and tile work all these years later. Still a fantastic foundation. Tiles still hung at straight angles, proper spacing between, a great example of his eye for detail. He taught me the meaning of integrity, honesty, and respect. He taught me to lay block. To erect doors with 90° angles. Roof. Floor. Tile. Stucco. Siding. Just because I was the ""baby girl"" of the family, my curiosity was always met with teaching. I knew I'd have to know how to do things for myself, as he did too.

"Why is it considered rude when a woman asks a man about his income before dating him? There’s a very popular dating show where a man will describe his dream woman. Almost all the men will list the same things: a woman who hasn’t had too many sexual partners, who cooks, cleans, and is willing to prioritize the children over her career. The men will get a lot of applause from the audience when they list these qualities. But once a woman asks a man, “How much do you make?” the audience will boo her.

"Did I get spiritually tied to this guy or was I just trauma bonded? Has anyone experienced something like this? A few years ago, right after my mom was hijacked and put into rehab to recover, I met this guy randomly at a Pizza spot. I was on my way to take my mom some food. We started chatting and instantly hit it off. Everything between us moved fast — like, *really fast*. He started taking me out on dates to some of the fanciest spots in the city. We were going out a lot, drinking, smoking, eating, just living it up. He would literally buy me anything I wanted. Naturally, I started sleeping over often and spending more and more time with him. But one thing that always stood out was how glued he was to his laptop. He was *always* on it. One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check it. And that’s when everything shifted. I discovered that he was talking to tons of people — not girls, but *guys*. At first I was confused, like... is he gay? But it turns out, this guy was a fraudster. He was defrauding people online and running scams. Eventually, he asked me to help him — specifically, to use my voice to speak to his “clients.” I don’t even remember how it started, but I agreed. Before I knew it, I was part of his circle. All his friends knew me, I was pulled into this weird world. Despite everything, he kept spoiling me, taking me out to places like expensive shopping sprees, clubbing, shopping, all of it. Then I found out he was *married* and had a child.

"FUASK Had a Chance to Be Different, but It’s Just More of the Same Federal University of Applied Sciences, Kachia (FUASK) In Kaduna, State, had a rare opportunity, a blank slate to rethink what a university could be in this country. It could have broken away from the stagnant, bureaucratic model we’ve seen replicated over and over again. It could have led with bold ideas, modern governance, and a focus on real-world application, innovation, and relevance. But of course… I was just daydreaming. Instead, what we’re seeing is the same old cargo model: tired structures, outdated academic frameworks, and recycled governance systems that have failed to deliver across countless institutions. No vision. No innovation. Just a fresh coat of paint on the same broken foundation. At this rate, FUASK won’t be a fresh start, it’ll just be another name on a long list of universities created for the sake of numbers, not impact. Another institution built on outdated blueprints, managed by people who aren’t interested in change, and designed to maintain the status quo. It’s sad because the potential was real. FUASK could have been a leading force; experimental, disruptive, grounded in applied sciences and contemporary challenges. Instead, it’s shaping up to be yet another missed opportunity in a system full of them.",Nigerian

"Did I get spiritually tied to this guy or was I just trauma bonded? Has anyone experienced something like this? A few years ago, right after my mom was hijacked and put into rehab to recover, I met this guy randomly at a Pizza spot. I was on my way to take my mom some food. We started chatting and instantly hit it off. Everything between us moved fast — like, *really fast*. He started taking me out on dates to some of the fanciest spots in the city. We were going out a lot, drinking, smoking, eating, just living it up. He would literally buy me anything I wanted. Naturally, I started sleeping over often and spending more and more time with him. But one thing that always stood out was how glued he was to his laptop. He was *always* on it. One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check it. And that’s when everything shifted. I discovered that he was talking to tons of people — not girls, but *guys*. At first I was confused, like... is he gay? But it turns out, this guy was a fraudster. He was defrauding people online and running scams. Eventually, he asked me to help him — specifically, to use my voice to speak to his “clients.” I don’t even remember how it started, but I agreed. Before I knew it, I was part of his circle. All his friends knew me, I was pulled into this weird world. Despite everything, he kept spoiling me, taking me out to places like expensive shopping sprees, clubbing, shopping, all of it. Then I found out he was *married* and had a child. At first, he claimed they weren’t together, but I saw messages and overheard calls that made it clear they very much were. That’s when things started getting toxic between us. But here’s the part that really confuses me: **I couldn’t leave him**. No matter what I found out, no matter how bad it got, I *just couldn’t walk away*.

"Why are Nigerian parents so toxic? They love to feed their ego, for example you're taught to kneel down to them as ""respect and a greeting"" but in all honesty it just to feed their ego and their desire of control. I could make a whole list of the problem with African parents especially Nigerian but I'm just going to ask you guys why they're like this? edit: it does make them toxic when they nitpick. Imagine waking up early at like 5 am (previously studying up until 12 am and the journey is also very long), then going to school with like 3 exams that are nearly all 2 hours, then having a 3-hour journey. Then when you come home, you're excited to tell your parent that you think you did well, only for them to be annoyed that you didn't bend down ""low enough"" despite knowing I have a bad knee and I'm very tired.

"🇳🇬🇸🇷Afro-Diasporian looking for Nigerian Pidgin & Afro Spirituality enthusiasts for linguistic and anthropological research 🇸🇷Ofa / How far 🇳🇬 my Naija brethren, I’m Afro-Surinamese and most of our Ancestors came from Central and West Africa. I’m doing research about our cultural origins and continuations in the West African region, specifically focusing on Nigeria (Benin, Togo and Ghana) at the moment. • Linguistics In the title I mentioned Nigerian Pidgin, because it’s an English-based Creole language on the continent of Africa closely resembling our English-based Creole in Suriname named “Sranantongo, Sranan”. Sierra Leonean Krio has a very close resemblance to ours as well. The West African influences in our Creole are from Fon, Yoruba, Igbo, Akan (Twi & Fante), Ewe, Mina, Nago, Efik, Ibibio, Mende etc. So if you speak Nigerian Pidgin and/or any of these languages and would like to engage feel free. I’ll show some comparative words and phrases between Sranan and ethnicities relevant to this Reddit to illustrate why I’m in this Reddit segment for my research. Unu 🇸🇷 | Una 🇳🇬 (Igbo) = they, us) | I 🇸🇷| i, ị 🇳🇬 (Igbo) = you | Na 🇸🇷 | Na 🇳🇬 (Igbo) = locative preposition & highlighter Fukufuku 🇸🇷 | Fùkùfùkù 🇳🇬 (Yor) = lungs | Pata 🇸🇷| Bàtà 🇳🇬(Yor) = shoes | Bakba 🇸🇷| Agbagba 🇳🇬 (Yor) = plantain | Bakra | mbakara 🇳🇬 (Efik) = white person | Okro 🇸🇷| Okworo, okworu, okwuru, okuru 🇳🇬 = okra Sabi 🇸🇷 = sabi 🇳🇬 = to know (Portuguese: saber) Pikin 🇸🇷 = pikin 🇳🇬 = child (Portuguese: pequeno) Ofa 🇸🇷 = How far 🇳🇬 = what’s up? | Fa yu de 🇸🇷 = How you dey 🇳🇬 = how are you? | Mi de 🇸🇷 = I dey 🇳🇬 = I exist (I am fine) | Mi e waka 🇸🇷= I dey waka = I am walking | Mi no e waka 🇸🇷 = I no dey waka 🇳🇬 = I am not walking | Mi o si yu tamara 🇸🇷 = I go see you tomorrow 🇳🇬 = I will see you tomorrow Mi sab tak.. 🇸🇷 = I sabi say.. = I know “that”.. | Mi no sabi 🇸🇷 = I no sabi 🇳🇬 = I don’t know | Na so 🇸🇷 = Na so 🇳🇬 = it is so | Mi begi 🇸🇷 = Abeg 🇳🇬 = I beg / please I think y’all get where I’m going with this. The similarities between Nigerian Pidgin and Sranan are overwhelmingly clear. • Anthropology My Anthropological research is about West and Central African Spirituality. Our Afro-Surinamese Spiritual system is called Winti. It didn’t syncretize with Christianity and remained fully African leaving us with a large pool of African cultural retention to research. Winti is also the name of our deities. Our equivalent of Vodun and Orishas. I’ll list some of our Winti lexicon that align with Vodun and Orishas below. Fodu 🇸🇷 = Vodun | Aysa 🇸🇷 = Ayizan | Adyida 🇸🇷 = Ayida-Weddo | Loko 🇸🇷 = Loko, Írókò | Leba 🇸🇷 = Legba | Watramama 🇸🇷 | Mami Wata, Yemoja, Oshun | Dagwe 🇸🇷 = Dagbe | Ase 🇸🇷 = Aṣẹ, àṣẹ, aṣe, ase, ashe. So if you speak Nigerian Pidgin or any West African language that could be relevant and would like to engage, feel free to comment below and/or get in contact. I look forward to network with y’all in the Diaspora about our shared African heritage 🇸🇷🇳🇬 ✊🏽✊🏿✊🏾 Please leave comments below and/or hit my DM to help the research of African Ancestral traditions in Afro-Surinamese culture with information",Nigerian

"My mother is getting scammed by a Nigerian. **TDLR:** My mother is daily scammed by a person from Abuja Nigeria. That started two years ago. Her husband died and this guy from the internet helped her to replace the void in her heart. She thought she was in love, she travelled and married him. They have been together only one month. Since she left, she is completely supporting him financially. She is a doctor in an eastern European country, that’s why she sends him from 150 euros to 400 euros daily, depending on what he claims what happened to him, and that’s ruining her financially. I need your advice what to do and how to stop him abusing my mother for money. I shared the whole story below. My father died in the end of 2021, leaving me and my mother the only members of our family. Depression hit hard my mother, her fear of living off her life alone without a husband was her biggest fear in life, though she was 54 at the moment, and her life definitely was not over, but she was overwhelmed by sadness. I tried to support her and be there for her but I was working and couldn’t be constantly with her. Little did I know what was going to happen even though I tried my best. In the the middle of 2022 she met a gentleman who was posing as a Finnish man in his 50s, my mother was no fool and she immediately realized he was a scammer, but continued talking to him because she was lonely and later that person revealed that he was a 36-year-old Nigerian, living with his family in Lagos. All was good, he was paying lots of attention to her and actually sounded like a decent fellow who could not find a job and hoped to cut some corners and get out of Nigeria. During that time I was very much surprised to learn that she wanted to go Nigeria and marry this man, to bring him into my country, which is located in Europe. At first I had no objections, but later I learned from our shared emails, since I help to run her medical private cabinet, that she was sending daily money to this man, around 50 euro, which for me was a huge red flag – you can’t buy love and where money is involved – there Is no love. I have talked to her, my girlfriend talked to her, many other people in her life tried to convince her that this is not normal, even people around her age that were interested in her romantically, but she did not listen. She went to Benin, since she did not get a visa to Nigeria and married this man. They were together only for a month. She said she loved him and he loved her, or in my opinion her money, because she was a doctor her whole life. She convinced me to bring him here because she was in love, and I wanted my mother to be happy so that was the logical thing. She told that he would not need this money if he was here. He applied for a visa 2 times in the embassy, two times he was denied though his documents were okay and his police report was clear, we hired lawyers to get the visa via court appeal, first one was denied and now we are waiting for the second one. The motivation was that the national security agency of our country denied him his appeal. During that time many things happened, the money she was sending was increasing, he became more bolder, the time he spent on my mother gradually decreased as the money increased. I learned that he smokes weed and amphetamines, he told my mother on their day of the wedding that he was a user and wanted to kick it, but seeing the expenses I highly doubt he stopped. He is lying to her constantly, always getting in “trouble “with the police saying he needs a money transfer to bribe them, or his phone is broken, or he needs to pay the hotel he is staying more money because something happened in the hotel – the hotel thing stopped after mother started paying his accommodations monthly and having a direct communication with the landlord. He thinks of thousand of reasons and emergencies for money transfers. It got so bad that on a good day he gets 100-150 euros on a bad day he gets 300-400 euros, and that is considering he does not pay for the place he stays. He does not pay for the internet, his phone or anything as a whole. He has a family with his father, mother, brother and two sisters living in a same city as him – Abuja. He stopped his communication with them a year ago even though they live in the same city and actually the place he is staying is close to them. I have talked to his sister and his mother, there are saying that he is lying and abusing substances, that my mother giving him so much money is ruining him, with which I completely agree. He has a bachelors degree in Geology but hasn’t worked in that field and is perfectly healthy, I know things are tought in Nigeria, but I don’t think he cannot find a job. I have countless talks with my mother about this, she agrees that she sends him too much money, we agree that a limit needs to be introduced but then he goes ahead and lies to her that something happened to him and he need money urgently and of course she sends him because of the fact she is afraid to lose him. When some “accident” happen to him and he start threating her that she won’t hear from him, that he is going to leave her, that he loves her but he does not know if he will be able to call her back again. And that is happening every day. She says that she loves him, even though that he acts in a very bad and abusive way. On top of everything my mother is working all the time and spends almost all her money on this person and even started to sell some of the family heirlooms to be able to get by. My girlfriend and I help pay most of the bills and groceries but this is too much. She started to decline in health and I am worried about this situation so much, and I don’t know what to do, to what authorities to go to. I have all his documents, including the passport and I know the location he is situated at. Can somebody help me with advice what to do in this situation and how to deal with this?",Nigerian

"Greetings in Yorùbá Greetings is one of the most important aspect of Yorùbá culture. I know you are familiar with ""Ẹ káàárọ̀, Ẹ kásàn and other basic greetings, but do you know how to express the greetings conversation fully. Greetings is conversational, you ought to also respond to the greetings. In Yorùbá, we have some basic words we use for greetings like"" Ẹ kúu, kú, ṣé, báwo, ńkọ́. Let's analyze them. 1. Ẹ KÚU /KÚ. ""Ẹ kúu"" is used to greet someone older, group of people and sign of respect even while greeting someone's age of group. This is what is used for most of the greetings. We can use ""Ẹ kaa with"" àárọ̀ (morning) , ọ̀sán (afternoon) , àbọ̀ (return). Example. A. Ẹ kúu iṣẹ́ - - - - - - Well done. B. Ẹ kúu oríire - - - - congratulations. C. Kú ọjọ́ mẹ́ta - - - - This is used to greet someone you have not seen in a while. 2. ṢÉ This could mean hope you , have you, will you depending on the content. But in greeting context, it mean ""hope you are"" Example. 1. Ṣé dáadáa ni--------hope you are fine Response: dáadáa ni/àlàáfíà ni---I am fine or at peace. 2. Ṣé dáadáa lo wà - - - still hope you are fine. Response :dáadáa ní mo wà. - - I am fine. To an older person you would say. Ṣé dáadáa lẹ wà. 3. BÁWO This is ""how"" in Yorùbá and it is also used for greeting. Example. 1. Báwo ni - - - - How are you. 2. Báwo ni nǹkan - - - How are things. 3. Báwo ni ilé - - - - - - - - How is family. 4. Báwo ni iṣẹ́ - - - - - - How is work. Response could also range from Dáadáa ní, àlàáfíà ni, ilé wà dáadáa (the family is fine). Iṣẹ́ ń lọ dáadáa (work is going fine). 4. Ń KỌ́.

What comes to your mind when you see a man or woman that is fat in Yorùbá, I mean robust, and not obese. So, this is it, according to the Yorùbá people, being fat is a sign of healthy living, living in affluence and having peace of mind. Unlike these days where everyone goes to the gym and no one cares whether you are fat or not.

"AI slop and guallable people. I was surfing through Twitter one day, and I saw a post that contained a picture of a YouTube video of Captain IB Traore being saved by a cow (). The video had over 500k views then, now about 843k. In my head, I thought surely people know this is AI slop? Then I went to the comments, and it was crazy, people actually believed that it happened. Sample comment: I was confused. Can people not distinguish between AI and real stuff? Anyways, I then decided to do a deep dive and then it started making sense to me. A lot of these accounts are engagement farming accounts. Since IB is genuinely popular and sparks interest at the moment, these accounts are taking advantage of the wave and farming engagement for money. They even add disclaimers that it is fictional work inspired by the life of Captain IB. Anyways, I found some of the stories very funny so I decided to share them here for a laugh. \- Our brother Wode Maya has been arrested for spying on IB on behalf of the West (CIA and DSG) during his visit to Burkina Faso. Sad stuff, I hope they temper justice with mercy and IB forgives him. \- His sister in-law tried to kill him with a poisoned perfume. I guess she didn't like him from day one. \- While the sister in-law is trying to kill him, his 6 year old son saved him. I don't know if the two events are related but I suspect they are. Something about Lion nor day born goat. Also the resemblance between the father and son is remarkable, they will not be needing DNA test. \- Captain IB isn't just for Africans in Africa but also for African Americans. I suspect he gave her a unit in those affordable housing projects we've been seeing online. Peak Pan-Africanism! \- It is not news that Burkina Faso was one of the first teams to qualify for the upcoming AFCON; to ensure that they win, the forward-thinking Captain has proposed to buy CR7 to play for Burkina Faso. Watch out for CR7 in Morocco. \- Our very own VDM was invited by IB after he was released from EFCC custody. IB does not like that Nigerians are oppressed by their governments. \- While world leaders were going to the Pope's inaugural speech, IB pens a letter to the Pope, and he responded to IB in a speech during the inauguration. (Look at the views! the comment section is crazier) \- The aura of IB is so powerful that an American woman travelled all the way to marry him. If she doesn't cross the ocean for you, she doesn't love you. IB teaching black kings not to settle for less. \- Lastly, why are Tinubu and his handlers trying to set up Captain IB? Can Tinubu focus on Nigeria? Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this as much as I did. The videos are crazy and sometimes funny. What I find funnier are the people in the comment who leg believe the stores; their comments are crazy. Lastly, I think that in the age of AI, media literacy is more important than ever. With the number of people who believe some of these stories, I will not be surprised to see this kind of strategy being deploy in the 2027 Nigerian election. We have a very long road ahead of us.",Nigerian

Sapala or àbárì by the Èkìtì people is made just like móí móí. The difference is that móí móí is made from beans, while àbárì from corn. 3 ÒGÌ/ÀKÀMÙ: It is a fermented cereal made from corn. It is similar to custard. The grains are soaked in water for up to 3 days before grinding and then sieve to remove the husk. It goes well with milk and sugar. 4. Ẹ̀KỌ: Ẹ̀kọ is made from Ògì, Ògì is thoroughly cooked, when it is cold it solidifies and we have our ẹ̀kọ. It is eaten with different food like móí móí, àkàrà. 5. ÀDÀLÙ : This is my favorite of the food from corn. Smiles. It is a corn and beans porridge. The corn and beans are cooked together and it gives a delicious taste rather than eating beans porridge alone. 6.

"🇳🇬🇸🇷Afro-Diasporian looking for Nigerian Pidgin & Afro Spirituality enthusiasts for linguistic and anthropological research 🇸🇷Ofa / How far 🇳🇬 my Naija brethren, I’m Afro-Surinamese and most of our Ancestors came from Central and West Africa. I’m doing research about our cultural origins and continuations in the West African region, specifically focusing on Nigeria (Benin, Togo and Ghana) at the moment. • Linguistics In the title I mentioned Nigerian Pidgin, because it’s an English-based Creole language on the continent of Africa closely resembling our English-based Creole in Suriname named “Sranantongo, Sranan”. Sierra Leonean Krio has a very close resemblance to ours as well. The West African influences in our Creole are from Fon, Yoruba, Igbo, Akan (Twi & Fante), Ewe, Mina, Nago, Efik, Ibibio, Mende etc. So if you speak Nigerian Pidgin and/or any of these languages and would like to engage feel free. I’ll show some comparative words and phrases between Sranan and ethnicities relevant to this Reddit to illustrate why I’m in this Reddit segment for my research. Unu 🇸🇷 | Una 🇳🇬 (Igbo) = they, us) | I 🇸🇷| i, ị 🇳🇬 (Igbo) = you | Na 🇸🇷 | Na 🇳🇬 (Igbo) = locative preposition & highlighter Fukufuku 🇸🇷 | Fùkùfùkù 🇳🇬 (Yor) = lungs | Pata 🇸🇷| Bàtà 🇳🇬(Yor) = shoes | Bakba 🇸🇷| Agbagba 🇳🇬 (Yor) = plantain | Bakra | mbakara 🇳🇬 (Efik) = white person | Okro 🇸🇷| Okworo, okworu, okwuru, okuru 🇳🇬 = okra Sabi 🇸🇷 = sabi 🇳🇬 = to know (Portuguese: saber) Pikin 🇸🇷 = pikin 🇳🇬 = child (Portuguese: pequeno) Ofa 🇸🇷 = How far 🇳🇬 = what’s up? | Fa yu de 🇸🇷 = How you dey 🇳🇬 = how are you? | Mi de 🇸🇷 = I dey 🇳🇬 = I exist (I am fine) | Mi e waka 🇸🇷= I dey waka = I am walking | Mi no e waka 🇸🇷 = I no dey waka 🇳🇬 = I am not walking | Mi o si yu tamara 🇸🇷 = I go see you tomorrow 🇳🇬 = I will see you tomorrow Mi sab tak.. 🇸🇷 = I sabi say.. = I know “that”.. | Mi no sabi 🇸🇷 = I no sabi 🇳🇬 = I don’t know | Na so 🇸🇷 = Na so 🇳🇬 = it is so | Mi begi 🇸🇷 = Abeg 🇳🇬 = I beg / please I think y’all get where I’m going with this. The similarities between Nigerian Pidgin and Sranan are overwhelmingly clear. • Anthropology My Anthropological research is about West and Central African Spirituality. Our Afro-Surinamese Spiritual system is called Winti. It didn’t syncretize with Christianity and remained fully African leaving us with a large pool of African cultural retention to research. Winti is also the name of our deities. Our equivalent of Vodun and Orishas. I’ll list some of our Winti lexicon that align with Vodun and Orishas below. Fodu 🇸🇷 = Vodun | Aysa 🇸🇷 = Ayizan | Adyida 🇸🇷 = Ayida-Weddo | Loko 🇸🇷 = Loko, Írókò | Leba 🇸🇷 = Legba | Watramama 🇸🇷 | Mami Wata, Yemoja, Oshun | Dagwe 🇸🇷 = Dagbe | Ase 🇸🇷 = Aṣẹ, àṣẹ, aṣe, ase, ashe. So if you speak Nigerian Pidgin or any West African language that could be relevant and would like to engage, feel free to comment below and/or get in contact. I look forward to network with y’all in the Diaspora about our shared African heritage 🇸🇷🇳🇬 ✊🏽✊🏿✊🏾 Please leave comments below and/or hit my DM to help the research of African Ancestral traditions in Afro-Surinamese culture with information",Nigerian

"Afro-Jamaican spirituality? Hey there. Please be patient with me, I am very new to this and not very educated. Recently I have felt a calling to explore different religions/spirituality. Both of my parents were born and raised in Jamaica, but moved to America to have me. I was raised super Christian, but would love to learn about African spirituality, specifically in Jamaica. My family is not open to discussing this with me, as they believe it is “evil”. I’ve particularly been interested in learning about Kumina, but there is such little information about it out there. I feel drawn to Jamaican history, as that is where my people come from, and I know very little about my ancestors. I just want to learn, and be less closed minded. Would you consider Kumina to be a “religion”? Is it something I can begin to practice at home? If so, what are some small spiritual things I can do to push me in the right direction? Is it like other African spiritualities, where I can get a “reading” from a religious official? What deities are present in Kumina? How could I learn/connect more? Do you have any good resources for learning about Afro-Jamaican spirituality?? Any and all information is welcome! Thanks for reading, and thank you in advance.",Jamaican

But if so many people do it, why is it still so risky. Like, are there Jamaicans that would actually rat someone out for smoking ganja? Because in the USA, in the illegal states, there’s plenty of people who would call the cops on someone for smoking weed. What I’m basically asking is, is the stereotype that like pretty much all Jamaicans love ganja even true? What does Babylon think of ganja smokers, do they actually think it’s wrong and don’t smoke it themselves? From the way media makes it out to be in the USA, it just looks like everybody in Jamaica smokes ganja so it’s hard for me to even think that someone would call the cops or something over it.",Jamaican

Another one is the security guard in my neighborhood. The man won't let me relax by the pool in peace watching me swim telling me how beautiful I am.

"If All Politicians Are the Same, Why Bother to Vote?"" Here in Jamaica, we’ve got two main political parties, and for many of us, it feels like both sides play the same game—promises, problems, and little progress. It’s easy to ask: “If nothing really changes, why should I vote?” But here’s the flip side: if you don’t vote, you lose your say. The people who show up to the polls are the ones shaping the future, even if it’s not the future you wanted. So what do we do when we feel politically stuck? Do we vote for the lesser evil? Do we demand better candidates? Do we spoil our ballots in protest? Do we organize beyond the ballot box? I’m genuinely curious: How do you handle political frustration in a system that feels broken? Especially for us here in JA—what’s the solution when both parties feel the same? Let’s talk.",Jamaican

"Are all/most Jamaicans pro weed? Okay so I know it’s obviously not gonna be all, but from what I’ve seen off the internet, smoking ganja in Jamaica is very common and nobody really seems to care. But if so many people do it, why is it still so risky. Like, are there Jamaicans that would actually rat someone out for smoking ganja? Because in the USA, in the illegal states, there’s plenty of people who would call the cops on someone for smoking weed. What I’m basically asking is, is the stereotype that like pretty much all Jamaicans love ganja even true? What does Babylon think of ganja smokers, do they actually think it’s wrong and don’t smoke it themselves? From the way media makes it out to be in the USA, it just looks like everybody in Jamaica smokes ganja so it’s hard for me to even think that someone would call the cops or something over it.",Jamaican

"Recommendations for 50th birthday in Caribbean Hi. My 50th is this January and I’ve had one wish for almost five decades: to wake up somewhere warm on my birthday :) I’ve been reading tons of posts but just feel overwhelmed so I was hoping for some specific feedback. The only Caribbean island we’ve ever been to is Vieques and we adored it. Friendly, not crowded, beautiful beaches, awesome kayaking, okay snorkeling, perfectly reasonable restaurants. We stayed at an affordable B&B and aren’t particularly keen on all-inclusive resorts. We could go back but there are many Caribbean islands and we don’t want to miss out on a different great experience. Any recommendations for a place with similar vibe? Thanks!",Jamaican

"Are decent Jamaican men back home interested in diaspora women? I am really interested to hear some thoughts on this? I am a 30 year old woman born in the UK. My Mum was born here and my pops was born in Jamaica. As many of you will understand, the more generations you are detached from your parents/grandparents country, the more removed you are from your culture. Personally I make an effort to go back to Jamaica on a yearly basis. Sometimes on a solo trip to visit family, sometimes girls trips to turn up or sometimes with my UK family. But I know deep down I would prefer a Jamaican partner. I want to start making an active effort towards settling down and in an ideal world I would settle down with a Jamaican born man. I want to settle back home in the future as I want my children to have strong ties to Jamaica. However I find it so hard to meet DECENT Jamaica born men in the UK. A lot of the ones I come across fit the ‘yardie’ stereotype and that’s not the kind of man I see myself with. I am thinking about taking dating seriously next time I’m in Jamaica and opening myself up to meeting new people. However I don’t know how us British diaspora women are perceived in Jamaica. I assume that people won’t take me seriously as there are so many beautiful educated women back home…and the ones who will take me seriously are probably looking a visa 😫 Has anyone had success living abroad and settling down with someone back home who has a good heart, is educated etc. How did you meet? Dating is hard enough already and I’m afraid my extra criteria’s just going to make it harder.",Jamaican

"Jamaica's Third Language: Gypsy Hi everyone! Yesterday, I posted a survey about cultural attitudes toward Jamaican Patois and Jamaican Standard English. If you already completed it, thank you so much — I truly appreciate your support. I now have a follow-up survey that still explores Patois and Standard English, but this time it includes Gypsy — Jamaica’s secret or coded language. I know many Jamaicans may not consider Gypsy a “real language,” often associating it with childhood games . However, that might not be the full story. For example, Vybz Kartel uses Gypsy in songs like “Genie Wine” and “Fever,” showing that it can also serve as a form of communication among adults. There is very little research on this Jamaican Pig Latin-style language, and as a linguistics major, I believe it’s important to give highlight an underrepresented language within Jamaican culture. I’ll be sharing a link to the survey, a relevant article, and the two songs mentioned above If you’re Jamaican-born and have 5–8 minutes to spare, I would love to have your input. It truly means a lot to me. Thanks again to everyone who completed the first survey — your support has been amazing!
