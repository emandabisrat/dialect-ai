"17 And Lost, I Need Advice :) I am 17 nearly 18 and ive just finished s6. Just over a year ago i had moved from south of england to EK, I have loved the move and the area im living in, im just not that good at picking up the scottish accents and what they are saying. This discourages me from doing jobs such as a waiter or working as a cashier as i am scared i wont pick it up properly. I am extremely lost in what i should do as there arent many part time/full time jobs near me apart from care assistants (I don't feel i would be very good at it) I've not really found what I am good at, or any main interests. I have heard people having bad experiences at apprenticeships being talked down to and doing the un-fun tasks instead of engaging in what they wanted to do. I don't want to go on benefits and want to contribute to society aswell as do something with my life. I did go into college when i was in england but it just was not for me, i would much rather work. Any tips for me? I'm not too good at asking for advice and i don't enjoy it much but i am just so lost.",Scottish

"Greetings in Yor√πb√° Greetings is one of the most important aspect of Yor√πb√° culture. I know you are familiar with ""·∫∏ k√°√†√°r·ªçÃÄ, ·∫∏ k√°s√†n and other basic greetings, but do you know how to express the greetings conversation fully. Greetings is conversational, you ought to also respond to the greetings. In Yor√πb√°, we have some basic words we use for greetings like"" ·∫∏ k√∫u, k√∫, ·π£√©, b√°wo, ≈Ñk·ªçÃÅ. Let's analyze them. 1. ·∫∏ K√öU /K√ö. ""·∫∏ k√∫u"" is used to greet someone older, group of people and sign of respect even while greeting someone's age of group. This is what is used for most of the greetings. We can use ""·∫∏ kaa with"" √†√°r·ªçÃÄ (morning) , ·ªçÃÄs√°n (afternoon) , √†b·ªçÃÄ (return). Example. A. ·∫∏ k√∫u i·π£·∫πÃÅ - - - - - - Well done. B. ·∫∏ k√∫u or√≠ire - - - - congratulations. C. K√∫ ·ªçj·ªçÃÅ m·∫πÃÅta - - - - This is used to greet someone you have not seen in a while. 2. ·π¢√â This could mean hope you , have you, will you depending on the content. But in greeting context, it mean ""hope you are"" Example. 1. ·π¢√© d√°ad√°a ni--------hope you are fine Response: d√°ad√°a ni/√†l√†√°f√≠√† ni---I am fine or at peace. 2. ·π¢√© d√°ad√°a lo w√† - - - still hope you are fine. Response :d√°ad√°a n√≠ mo w√†. - - I am fine. To an older person you would say. ·π¢√© d√°ad√°a l·∫π w√†. 3. B√ÅWO This is ""how"" in Yor√πb√° and it is also used for greeting. Example. 1. B√°wo ni - - - - How are you. 2. B√°wo ni n«πkan - - - How are things. 3. B√°wo ni il√© - - - - - - - - How is family. 4. B√°wo ni i·π£·∫πÃÅ - - - - - - How is work. Response could also range from D√°ad√°a n√≠, √†l√†√°f√≠√† ni, il√© w√† d√°ad√°a (the family is fine). I·π£·∫πÃÅ ≈Ñ l·ªç d√°ad√°a (work is going fine). 4. ≈É K·ªåÃÅ.

"If All Politicians Are the Same, Why Bother to Vote?"" Here in Jamaica, we‚Äôve got two main political parties, and for many of us, it feels like both sides play the same game‚Äîpromises, problems, and little progress. It‚Äôs easy to ask: ‚ÄúIf nothing really changes, why should I vote?‚Äù But here‚Äôs the flip side: if you don‚Äôt vote, you lose your say. The people who show up to the polls are the ones shaping the future, even if it‚Äôs not the future you wanted. So what do we do when we feel politically stuck? Do we vote for the lesser evil? Do we demand better candidates? Do we spoil our ballots in protest? Do we organize beyond the ballot box? I‚Äôm genuinely curious: How do you handle political frustration in a system that feels broken? Especially for us here in JA‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the solution when both parties feel the same? Let‚Äôs talk.",Jamaican

"Inside The Secretive Group Tearing Down Colonial Statues | SBS This report from SBS popped up on my feed today and caught my interest.

"AI slop and guallable people. I was surfing through Twitter one day, and I saw a post that contained a picture of a YouTube video of Captain IB Traore being saved by a cow (). The video had over 500k views then, now about 843k. In my head, I thought surely people know this is AI slop? Then I went to the comments, and it was crazy, people actually believed that it happened. Sample comment: I was confused. Can people not distinguish between AI and real stuff? Anyways, I then decided to do a deep dive and then it started making sense to me. A lot of these accounts are engagement farming accounts. Since IB is genuinely popular and sparks interest at the moment, these accounts are taking advantage of the wave and farming engagement for money. They even add disclaimers that it is fictional work inspired by the life of Captain IB. Anyways, I found some of the stories very funny so I decided to share them here for a laugh. \- Our brother Wode Maya has been arrested for spying on IB on behalf of the West (CIA and DSG) during his visit to Burkina Faso. Sad stuff, I hope they temper justice with mercy and IB forgives him. \- His sister in-law tried to kill him with a poisoned perfume. I guess she didn't like him from day one. \- While the sister in-law is trying to kill him, his 6 year old son saved him. I don't know if the two events are related but I suspect they are. Something about Lion nor day born goat. Also the resemblance between the father and son is remarkable, they will not be needing DNA test. \- Captain IB isn't just for Africans in Africa but also for African Americans. I suspect he gave her a unit in those affordable housing projects we've been seeing online. Peak Pan-Africanism! \- It is not news that Burkina Faso was one of the first teams to qualify for the upcoming AFCON; to ensure that they win, the forward-thinking Captain has proposed to buy CR7 to play for Burkina Faso. Watch out for CR7 in Morocco. \- Our very own VDM was invited by IB after he was released from EFCC custody. IB does not like that Nigerians are oppressed by their governments. \- While world leaders were going to the Pope's inaugural speech, IB pens a letter to the Pope, and he responded to IB in a speech during the inauguration. (Look at the views! the comment section is crazier) \- The aura of IB is so powerful that an American woman travelled all the way to marry him. If she doesn't cross the ocean for you, she doesn't love you. IB teaching black kings not to settle for less. \- Lastly, why are Tinubu and his handlers trying to set up Captain IB? Can Tinubu focus on Nigeria? Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this as much as I did. The videos are crazy and sometimes funny. What I find funnier are the people in the comment who leg believe the stores; their comments are crazy. Lastly, I think that in the age of AI, media literacy is more important than ever. With the number of people who believe some of these stories, I will not be surprised to see this kind of strategy being deploy in the 2027 Nigerian election. We have a very long road ahead of us.",Nigerian

"Caribbean Travel Advice My husband and I are planning our 20th anniversary trip, no kids.

We'd like to go someplace where the local residents aren't exploited for their labor and culture, a place we can enjoy the food whether it's in a fancy restaurant or a roadside stand. We're open to all-inclusives or places that have food on-site. Happy to travel to local towns for excursions. We're looking at Jamaica, St. Maartin, Antigua so far.

"My mother is getting scammed by a Nigerian. **TDLR:** My mother is daily scammed by a person from Abuja Nigeria. That started two years ago. Her husband died and this guy from the internet helped her to replace the void in her heart. She thought she was in love, she travelled and married him. They have been together only one month. Since she left, she is completely supporting him financially. She is a doctor in an eastern European country, that‚Äôs why she sends him from 150 euros to 400 euros daily, depending on what he claims what happened to him, and that‚Äôs ruining her financially. I need your advice what to do and how to stop him abusing my mother for money. I shared the whole story below. My father died in the end of 2021, leaving me and my mother the only members of our family. Depression hit hard my mother, her fear of living off her life alone without a husband was her biggest fear in life, though she was 54 at the moment, and her life definitely was not over, but she was overwhelmed by sadness. I tried to support her and be there for her but I was working and couldn‚Äôt be constantly with her. Little did I know what was going to happen even though I tried my best. In the the middle of 2022 she met a gentleman who was posing as a Finnish man in his 50s, my mother was no fool and she immediately realized he was a scammer, but continued talking to him because she was lonely and later that person revealed that he was a 36-year-old Nigerian, living with his family in Lagos. All was good, he was paying lots of attention to her and actually sounded like a decent fellow who could not find a job and hoped to cut some corners and get out of Nigeria. During that time I was very much surprised to learn that she wanted to go Nigeria and marry this man, to bring him into my country, which is located in Europe. At first I had no objections, but later I learned from our shared emails, since I help to run her medical private cabinet, that she was sending daily money to this man, around 50 euro, which for me was a huge red flag ‚Äì you can‚Äôt buy love and where money is involved ‚Äì there Is no love. I have talked to her, my girlfriend talked to her, many other people in her life tried to convince her that this is not normal, even people around her age that were interested in her romantically, but she did not listen. She went to Benin, since she did not get a visa to Nigeria and married this man. They were together only for a month. She said she loved him and he loved her, or in my opinion her money, because she was a doctor her whole life. She convinced me to bring him here because she was in love, and I wanted my mother to be happy so that was the logical thing. She told that he would not need this money if he was here. He applied for a visa 2 times in the embassy, two times he was denied though his documents were okay and his police report was clear, we hired lawyers to get the visa via court appeal, first one was denied and now we are waiting for the second one. The motivation was that the national security agency of our country denied him his appeal. During that time many things happened, the money she was sending was increasing, he became more bolder, the time he spent on my mother gradually decreased as the money increased. I learned that he smokes weed and amphetamines, he told my mother on their day of the wedding that he was a user and wanted to kick it, but seeing the expenses I highly doubt he stopped. He is lying to her constantly, always getting in ‚Äútrouble ‚Äúwith the police saying he needs a money transfer to bribe them, or his phone is broken, or he needs to pay the hotel he is staying more money because something happened in the hotel ‚Äì the hotel thing stopped after mother started paying his accommodations monthly and having a direct communication with the landlord. He thinks of thousand of reasons and emergencies for money transfers. It got so bad that on a good day he gets 100-150 euros on a bad day he gets 300-400 euros, and that is considering he does not pay for the place he stays. He does not pay for the internet, his phone or anything as a whole. He has a family with his father, mother, brother and two sisters living in a same city as him ‚Äì Abuja. He stopped his communication with them a year ago even though they live in the same city and actually the place he is staying is close to them. I have talked to his sister and his mother, there are saying that he is lying and abusing substances, that my mother giving him so much money is ruining him, with which I completely agree. He has a bachelors degree in Geology but hasn‚Äôt worked in that field and is perfectly healthy, I know things are tought in Nigeria, but I don‚Äôt think he cannot find a job. I have countless talks with my mother about this, she agrees that she sends him too much money, we agree that a limit needs to be introduced but then he goes ahead and lies to her that something happened to him and he need money urgently and of course she sends him because of the fact she is afraid to lose him. When some ‚Äúaccident‚Äù happen to him and he start threating her that she won‚Äôt hear from him, that he is going to leave her, that he loves her but he does not know if he will be able to call her back again. And that is happening every day. She says that she loves him, even though that he acts in a very bad and abusive way. On top of everything my mother is working all the time and spends almost all her money on this person and even started to sell some of the family heirlooms to be able to get by. My girlfriend and I help pay most of the bills and groceries but this is too much. She started to decline in health and I am worried about this situation so much, and I don‚Äôt know what to do, to what authorities to go to. I have all his documents, including the passport and I know the location he is situated at. Can somebody help me with advice what to do in this situation and how to deal with this?",Nigerian

"Scottish MSc vs American MA/moving abroad after graduation Hi everyone! I am currently studying abroad at UofG and I love it so much that I am looking at it for next year when I go to graduate school. I graduate from a university in Washington, D.C. with a degree in Political Science and Economics, i have a decently stacked resume with unique experiences and internships/extracurriculars. My GPA could be higher IMO but I went through some significant personal strifes in my undergrad so I think I could write a letter explaining that. Anyway, I've fallen in love with Glasgow and the University, and on top of that, UGlasgow's Masters in Political Communication is only one full year vs a two year MA in Political Communication at schools I'm looking at in DC. UG is also significantly cheaper even with USD conversion, without scholarships/aid I would be saving about 80k. It's also a MSc which is interesting because most schools I'm looking at in the States are only an MA-- so my question is \*\*is there a significant difference between these that would lead me to choose one over the other? What are upsides and downsides to getting an international Masters vs a States masters if my long-term goal is to stay in the States after my graduation?

"Texas AG Ken Paxton Can Access Your Prescription Records >PDMP datasets typically include patient details, medication dosages, refill schedules, and identifying information for the prescriber and pharmacy. In nine states, the PDMP entry even contains the diagnosis code (ICD-10) associated with the prescription. That means a police officer scrutinizing the file could directly see why a person was prescribed a drug. In states like Tennessee or Florida, which track diagnoses, a record showing testosterone cypionate accompanied by an ICD code for ‚Äúgender dysphoria‚Äù would immediately telegraph that the patient is transgender. >As is often the case with law enforcement surveillance tools, PDMPs have proven susceptible to mission creep, Oliva writes, noting that most state programs now track not only opioids but ‚Äúall controlled substances as well as non-controlled ‚Äòdrugs of concern.‚Äô‚Äù In other words, a system built to catch illicit OxyContin refills has quietly become a mechanism to monitor any number of treatments ‚Äì from anxiety medications and stimulants for the treatment of ADHD to testosterone for gender transition. >Crucially, this vast trove of prescription records exists in a legal gray zone outside standard medical privacy protections. The questions about HIPAA compliance typically come up when I've discussed this subject. However, once a pharmacy uploads your data to a PDMP, that information is no longer covered by HIPAA privacy rules. Instead, each state dictates who can access the PDMP and for what purpose. Unfortunately, law enforcement agencies have lobbied hard for access. >Today, every state allows police or prosecutors to retrieve PDMP data, often without so much as a warrant. In many jurisdictions, all it takes is an administrative request or subpoena to sift through a person‚Äôs prescription history. Some PDMPs even generate unsolicited alerts such as if the software‚Äôs algorithms deem someone‚Äôs prescribing or usage ‚Äúsuspicious,‚Äù it can automatically tip off law enforcement. [...] >In their quest to create a gender bureaucracy to police the lives of transgender people, the anti-trans side is on board with the creation of an Orwellian surveillance state that tracks everyone's prescriptions. >Given how much more prevalent hormone prescriptions are among the cisgender population, any attempt to police and surveil transgender people's prescriptions will inevitably catch orders of magnitude more cis people in the surveillance dragnet. But that's entirely the intention. In this situation, it's become explicitly clear that transgender people are a mere pretext to enable a mass surveillance system to gain control over everyone's bodies and what prescriptions they are able to take. Ken Paxton and his cronies can access your prescription records, even if you don't live in Texas. It's a system so ripe for abuse, that it ultimately must be dismantled.",Southern US

I met my current fianc√©e a few years ago, and we are in the process of getting married. However, I've noticed some behavior that I don't understand. My wife is from Nigeria, and therefore it is not easy to get married in Germany. But with all the hurdles, e.g. documents and other data that we have to prove, it's always Germany's fault. Although most of the requirements come from the Nigerian government, as far as I understand it. But this is also an issue when it comes to the current situation in Nigeria, e.g. the recent crash of the Naira currency and other topics. From her point of view, other countries are always to blame (mainly Europe because of slavery or exploitation), understandable up to a point. However, the high level of corruption, as she always expresses herself, or problems with the infrastructure cannot come exclusively from outside, can they? A fresh example here would also be the African Union. My wife came to me the other day and said that it was Europe's fault that Africa didn't have a common currency and that all the other countries were trying to sabotage the Union because Africa, as a world power, would subjugate everyone. And when I checked and saw that the European Union was donating quite a lot of money to support the African Union, she said it was false information or public excuses to look good. **I don't want to start a political or historical discussion here, I just want to have a better understanding.

Honorific pronouns are respectful pronouns, Yor√πb√° does not indicate gender but we place emphasis on respect and this is where we make use of the Honorific pronoun. This is used when we are speaking to either an older person, plural or in polite conversation or formal conversation with someone. We have four of them 1. ·∫∏ - you (all). It is used with greetings, question markers and it is placed in the subject position, it comes before the verb. 2. Y√çN - YOU.

"Nigerian Dialect Needed for Play Hello! I'm a part of a college theatre company currently in production for a play that requires all players to speak in one Nigerian dialect. So, the play is in English but needs to be performed with a Nigerian accent. When casting, we tried to find folks who were already comfortable speaking a Nigerian dialect/accent but weren't very successful. Now we have half a cast that is totally uncomfortable doing an accent or even attempting one. Additionally, the cast members who can do an accent/dialect don't know how to give direction to the others who can't.

"Did I get spiritually tied to this guy or was I just trauma bonded? Has anyone experienced something like this? A few years ago, right after my mom was hijacked and put into rehab to recover, I met this guy randomly at a Pizza spot. I was on my way to take my mom some food. We started chatting and instantly hit it off. Everything between us moved fast ‚Äî like, *really fast*. He started taking me out on dates to some of the fanciest spots in the city. We were going out a lot, drinking, smoking, eating, just living it up. He would literally buy me anything I wanted. Naturally, I started sleeping over often and spending more and more time with him. But one thing that always stood out was how glued he was to his laptop. He was *always* on it. One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check it. And that‚Äôs when everything shifted. I discovered that he was talking to tons of people ‚Äî not girls, but *guys*. At first I was confused, like... is he gay? But it turns out, this guy was a fraudster. He was defrauding people online and running scams. Eventually, he asked me to help him ‚Äî specifically, to use my voice to speak to his ‚Äúclients.‚Äù I don‚Äôt even remember how it started, but I agreed. Before I knew it, I was part of his circle. All his friends knew me, I was pulled into this weird world. Despite everything, he kept spoiling me, taking me out to places like expensive shopping sprees, clubbing, shopping, all of it. Then I found out he was *married* and had a child. At first, he claimed they weren‚Äôt together, but I saw messages and overheard calls that made it clear they very much were. That‚Äôs when things started getting toxic between us. But here‚Äôs the part that really confuses me: **I couldn‚Äôt leave him**. No matter what I found out, no matter how bad it got, I *just couldn‚Äôt walk away*. Now, I‚Äôve been out of that relationship for a few years. I feel nothing for him anymore, I‚Äôve moved on, and I‚Äôm not in contact with him at all. But I still find myself wondering: **Was that guy using some kind of juju or spiritual manipulation on me? Or was I just trauma bonded?** Has anyone else been through something similar ‚Äî where leaving felt impossible, like you were under some sort of hold?",Nigerian

"Half-Scottish, Half-English identity crisis. I was born in Scotland and lived there until I was 8, then moved down to England, I moved back up to Scotland 4 years ago, so technically most my life I've lived in Scotland. My dad is Scottish and my mum is English, and especially on my dad's side it's always felt like he's trying to get me to 'choose a side'. I have a neutral accent (sounds almost south-african), from living in other countries on and off, so that doesn't decide anything. And i'm also wondering if I have to even choose a side. It feels like I do when i'm living here, I often get asked 'which more do I feel', and I honestly have absolutely no idea. I've never thought of it as much of a big deal, almost to the point I feel neither Scottish or English. I'm making this post because I was at the pub the other day and a guy asked where I was from and I told him I had grown up in England but was half-Scottish, and he told me to my face I wasn't Scottish at all, which stinged a little bit to be honest. I have no views on the politics side of things, Scottish independence is something you'll have to ask someone else about, I'm not educated enough on it to form a coherent opinion. What I do know is I love Scotland and I love England, I've made so many beautiful memories in both of them, and wouldn't give up one over the other - however in a country(s) where the line is drawn so boldly, it's hard to feel like I belong to both of them.",Scottish

"Soup beans (pintos) with mayonnaise. Last night's post and conversation about food really got me feeling sentimental. I was talking to my husband about some of the things I ate growing up, that he had absolutely no concept of. One of them was soup beans with a dollop of mayo. Then we'd mix the mayo in to make kind of a creamy sauce. It was delicious, and for the longest time, the only way I'd ever eat mayo. My pappaw would always have a glass of buttermilk, but I just wanted ""sweet milk."" He also had to have cornbread with his beans, but I preferred mine straight up. So after this conversation, I was really craving this meal that I'd not eaten in decades. I didn't have any dried beans, but I did heat up a can of pintos and then dropped in a spoonful of Duke's. Then I poured a cold glass of milk, and that mix of textures, flavors and memories was just heavenly. My parents only ever used JFG mayonnaise, and I think Dad still does. I grew up in Upper East TN, so JFG was relatively ""local"", being from Knoxville, but I'm wondering how many other people had that in their fridge?

It's not normal at all"" or ""Ugly, ***kwa***? What are you talking about?""; I assume this word is used to express disagreement or surprise, it that right? 2. ***o rika*** - this phrase appeared in the sentence: ""Thirty-five is too much, ***o rika***, biko"" 3. **rapuba** - as in a sentence: ""It will happen for you, don't worry, **rapuba**"" 4. ***shay*** - this one possibly comes from Nigerian Pidgin but, of course, correct me if I'm wrong; it was used in this context: ""Ifemelu did not have the heart to tell her that nobody said ""**shay**"" any more"" and from this I gathered that shay is a word popular among teenagers in Nigeria that after all became obsolete 5. ***sah*** - as in: ""I hope everything is fine, ***sah***"" And a few longer excerpts: 1. ***I maka.*** - (""You put on some weight and it suits you. ***I maka***."") 2. ***Ife esika kita***. - (""***Ife esika kita.*** The recession is biting everybody."") 3. ***I ga-askiwa***. - (""(‚Ä¶) but you Igbo people? ***I ga-askiwa.***"") 4. ***Aru adikwa***? - (""***Aru adikwa?***"" Obinze shrugged. ""I'm fine.

Today's, let's learn some of the foods we can get from corn. 1. √àGBO: This food is made from dry corn which is cooked until it is very soft. It is eaten alongside beans and sauce. It is common among the √åb√†d√†n people. 2. √ÄB√ÄR√ç /SAPALA: Do you know m√≥√≠ m√≥√≠? Sapala or √†b√°r√¨ by the √àk√¨t√¨ people is made just like m√≥√≠ m√≥√≠. The difference is that m√≥√≠ m√≥√≠ is made from beans, while √†b√°r√¨ from corn. 3 √íG√å/√ÄK√ÄM√ô: It is a fermented cereal made from corn. It is similar to custard. The grains are soaked in water for up to 3 days before grinding and then sieve to remove the husk. It goes well with milk and sugar. 4. ·∫∏ÃÄK·ªå: ·∫∏ÃÄk·ªç is made from √íg√¨, √íg√¨ is thoroughly cooked, when it is cold it solidifies and we have our ·∫πÃÄk·ªç. It is eaten with different food like m√≥√≠ m√≥√≠, √†k√†r√†. 5. √ÄD√ÄL√ô : This is my favorite of the food from corn. Smiles. It is a corn and beans porridge. The corn and beans are cooked together and it gives a delicious taste rather than eating beans porridge alone. 6. K√ìK√ìR√ì : This is a snack made from a paste of maize flour mixed with sugar and deep friend. 7. BOILED CORN (√Ägb√†do s√≠s√®) 8. ROASTES CORN (√Ägb√†do s√≠sun). Your Yor√πb√° tutor.

"My daddy's legacy My dad passed away last fall, and now it's been on my heart to photograph things I know he built long ago. From Heidrick KY, born in 52, he grew up doing construction with his family. This building was erected during the late 60s or early 70s. Look at that prestine block and tile work all these years later. Still a fantastic foundation. Tiles still hung at straight angles, proper spacing between, a great example of his eye for detail. He taught me the meaning of integrity, honesty, and respect. He taught me to lay block. To erect doors with 90¬∞ angles. Roof. Floor. Tile. Stucco. Siding. Just because I was the ""baby girl"" of the family, my curiosity was always met with teaching. I knew I'd have to know how to do things for myself, as he did too. By the time I was 8 I could use a miter saw as good as the best of them. I'm going to get pictures of a cabin we built together as soon as I can.

"Afro-Jamaican spirituality? Hey there. Please be patient with me, I am very new to this and not very educated. Recently I have felt a calling to explore different religions/spirituality. Both of my parents were born and raised in Jamaica, but moved to America to have me. I was raised super Christian, but would love to learn about African spirituality, specifically in Jamaica. My family is not open to discussing this with me, as they believe it is ‚Äúevil‚Äù. I‚Äôve particularly been interested in learning about Kumina, but there is such little information about it out there. I feel drawn to Jamaican history, as that is where my people come from, and I know very little about my ancestors. I just want to learn, and be less closed minded. Would you consider Kumina to be a ‚Äúreligion‚Äù? Is it something I can begin to practice at home? If so, what are some small spiritual things I can do to push me in the right direction? Is it like other African spiritualities, where I can get a ‚Äúreading‚Äù from a religious official? What deities are present in Kumina? How could I learn/connect more? Do you have any good resources for learning about Afro-Jamaican spirituality?? Any and all information is welcome! Thanks for reading, and thank you in advance.",Jamaican

"Note to the Lawpadi Network - May 20, 2025 Legal Term of the Week - Mandamus Mandamus is a Latin word meaning ‚Äúwe command.‚Äù In legal terms, it refers to a court order that compels a public official, agency, or body to perform a duty they are legally obligated to carry out. JAMB Error Earlier this month, the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) publicly admitted that a technical error during the 2025 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) affected the scores of over 370,000 candidates. The affected students, many of whom sat the exam in Lagos and the South-East, were issued incorrect scores due to a failed deployment of updated scoring software on servers in 157 centers. JAMB has apologised and offered retake exams. But for students whose results were compromised ‚Äî and whose academic futures may hang in the balance ‚Äî one question now looms: what legal rights do they have? Can the Candidates Sue JAMB? JAMB is a statutory body set up under the JAMB Act, Cap J1 LFN 2004, and it owes a legal obligation to conduct exams with integrity, transparency, and equal treatment of all candidates. This obligation includes the duty to maintain functioning systems that produce accurate scores. Now, because JAMB is a public institution, its decisions fall under the principles of administrative law, and so there is technically a path to legal redress. In today's newsletter we discuss how: Option 1: Judicial Review at the Federal High Court Candidates can approach the Federal High Court to request a judicial review of JAMB's conduct. This type of legal action asks the court to examine whether JAMB's actions were lawful, fair, and within its statutory powers. The court may: Declare the original results invalid or unfair; Compel JAMB to re-issue corrected results; Order that affected students be reconsidered for admission or scholarship programmes. What the challenges are: Judicial review does not provide compensation ‚Äî it only offers corrective relief. The process can be lengthy and technical, requiring legal expertise and court filing fees. The applicant must demonstrate that internal remedies (like complaints to JAMB) were first exhausted. Option 2: Suing for Damages This route is more complex than judicial review. A candidate would be required to sue JAMB for negligence or breach of statutory duty and prove three things: That JAMB owed them a duty of care; That this duty was breached (e.g., via a preventable technical error); That the breach directly caused a financial or reputational loss. Examples where this might apply include: Losing admission into a university with no fallback option; Missing a scholarship opportunity due to incorrect scores; Suffering emotional or professional harm traceable to the error. What the challenges are: Courts in Nigeria are reluctant to award large damages against public institutions unless there is: Clear evidence of deliberate wrongdoing, Severe and proven losses, or A breach that clearly violated a statutory or constitutional right. Proof of damage must be concrete and not speculative (e.g., letters showing admission rejection, revoked scholarships). Legal costs may outweigh the likely award unless the case is exceptional. Option 3: Class Action or Group Litigation Where multiple candidates from the same centre or region were affected, they may bring a representative action ‚Äî commonly referred to as a class action. Affected students, through legal counsel, could seek: A declaration that JAMB breached its statutory obligations; A structured redress scheme (e.g., re-evaluation, preferential admission review); Collective compensation where direct financial loss can be established. What the challenges are: Class actions are rare in education law cases in Nigeria and would require strong coordination. Candidates must prove a shared interest and similar harm, and agree on representation. Outcomes still depend on the court's discretion and willingness to provide remedies beyond administrative orders.

Best regards, Tunde for the Lawpadi Team Good Law, Bad Law The Supreme Court held in Garba v University of Maiduguri, that even where a university believes a student committed misconduct, it must still follow due process before imposing punishment like expulsion.

"Virgin Gorda, BVI - looking for recommendations Heading to Mahoe Bay, Virgin Gorda in 2 weeks and trying to round out our trip details‚Ä¶this will be our 4th time visiting Virgin Gorda, but a lot has changed since the last time (pre-Covid), and our kids are older now (18, 13, 12 - all boys). I would welcome your suggestions on the following: - ANEGADA - we haven‚Äôt been yet, but we are going this trip. Do you recommend taking the ferry, full-day private charter, or renting a boat? ‚Ä¶the charter seems expensive for going to and staying at one island all day (versus island hopping from Normal to Copper to JVD to the Willy T kind of thing, which we plan to do another day) ‚Ä¶ferry is an early departure from VG (~7:00 AM), which is fine because we want to have the day at Anegada - just curious what folks think about getting there via the ferry ‚Ä¶boat rental would be great, and we are from the coast and experienced boaters so comfortable renting a boat (power or sail, but had contemplated renting a power boat for speed and ease); however, I haven‚Äôt found a day boat rental that would allow us to take the boat to Anegada from VG (and, this may not be the best option anyway, which is of course why I‚Äôm asking for suggestions) - SABA ROCK, LITTLE DIX BAY, BITTER END YACHT CLUB, ETC. - We are only there 10 nights, so we can‚Äôt hit everything‚Ä¶suggestions between these locales and others? Recommendations on what to do each place? Saba Rock looks amazing and we‚Äôve not previously been, but it also looks hard to access without a boat. I see that there is a ferry from Gun Creek, but it says for ‚Äúguests‚Äù - maybe a dinner reservation makes us guests? - FISHING? - the boys and my husband went deep sea fishing during one of our past trips but didn‚Äôt have a whole lot of luck that day. I see there is also fishing from shore/flats at Bitter End and I‚Äôm sure there are other options too. Thoughts on fishing? - from land? From sea? Not at all? - PRIVATE CHEFS? - in the past, we did about half of our meals at the villa and hired the services of a private chef. Chef Erica was our chef most recently, and we all adored her and the food was incredible, as is Erica‚Äôs personality and energy. She was lined up to cook for us again in March 2020, but then Covid shut things down and we had to cancel our trip. I emailed Erica recently but have not heard back from her yet‚Ä¶who knows if she has the same email as 5 years ago?!? In the event I don‚Äôt hear from Erica, can anyone share suggestions for a private chef to cook for us at our villa? We arrive on Sunday, April 13th (my birthday! üòÅ), so it would be wonderful to have a private chef cook for us that first evening as we will likely be tired from travel and will want to get settled‚Ä¶I think we arrive in Spanish Town via water taxi around 4:30 PM Sunday. - CHARTERS - chartered with Double D in the past and it was wonderful. Looking at other options this time as Dave‚Äôs website appears to be down, but will be reaching out to him via social media too. Nevertheless, what are your recommendations for the best reasonably priced charter companies and what itinerary do you suggest? Going to Willy T is non-negotiable for my boys this time, but if a full or half day charter isn‚Äôt the best use of our time and $ this trip, we would consider a ‚Äúdinner‚Äù charter to Willy T, or if folks have suggestions on other ways to get there, I welcome those. - WATERSPORTS/RENTALS - in the past we‚Äôve rented paddle boards and kept them at our villa. However, we also spent most of our time on the beach at Mahoe Bay during our past trips because when we had the kids with us (most recent 2 trips), they were babies‚Ä¶(literally, my youngest had just turned 2 or 3 the last time we were there, and the older boys were 3 or 4 and 7)‚Ä¶SO, we anticipate being a lot more active in doing things outside of Mahoe Bay‚Äôs beautiful beach this time, so I‚Äôm not sure a paddle board or other rental will be worth it. Are there places to rent jet skis, paddle boards, sailboats, etc by the hour, and if so, do you recommend? - ‚ÄúCAN‚ÄôT MISS‚Äù THINGS TO DO - Here are the things we‚Äôve done in the past - many of which we plan to do this trip too - and/or that we already have planned for this trip: Baths, Hog Heaven, Willy T, JVD, Tortola (including dolphins), Cocomaya‚Ä¶WHAT ‚ÄúCAN‚ÄôT MISS‚Äù THINGS ARE WE MISSING?

Also, I‚Äôm actually putting together a detailed itinerary with links and details of a variety of places, which I‚Äôd be happy to share as part of the post or send anyone who requests it.

"Mental health in Nigeria In the spirit of mental health awareness month, it would be nice to have a conversation about mental health in Nigeria. While it‚Äôs better these days (people are aware of depression and anxiety), many people in Nigeria have untrue beliefs about mental health and mental illness. Here are some things I‚Äôve learnt from my experience as a Nigerian living with mental illnesses in Nigeria: 1. It‚Äôs not as rare as you think. It is highly underdiagnosed for many reasons and people self medicate with alcohol and other substances. 2. Getting help is not as expensive as you think. While the healthcare system has its issues, I‚Äôve never spent up to 5,000 naira to see a psychiatrist or psychologist in a federal hospital since I started receiving care. 3. While depression and anxiety are common, they‚Äôre not the only mental illnesses that exist. There are over 200 mental health disorders. A lot of ‚Äúweird‚Äù people may be ill, and need support not shaming. 4. Mental health disorders can be treated. Even the people on the streets can fully recover with the right treatment. I have seen many cases where this happened. 5. Religious fanaticism is not spiritual psychosis. Thanks to TikTok psychology, Twitter people, especially know of the term and label weird behaviours linked to religious beliefs as religious psychosis. They are not the same. 6. People with mental health disorders are not possessed. It is not a punishment for sin or result of generational curses. It is just an illness. 7. Experiencing sadness or fear doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve had an anxiety disorder or depression before. There is a reason why they are classified as illnesses. When people who have actual diagnosis are talking about their experiences, it is unfair to invalidate them by treating it like normal human emotions. There are some things you can‚Äôt understand if you haven‚Äôt experienced them. Just empathise and support them. 8. Some ‚Äújokes‚Äù are quite insensitive. You wouldn‚Äôt mock someone who has cancer for being ill, extend that same grace to people living with mental health conditions. 9. For Nigerians with mental illnesses that are reading this, you‚Äôre not alone. There are so many Nigerians who can relate to you and know the weight of your pain. It is not an ‚Äúoyinbo‚Äù thing. I have more things to say but I‚Äôll stop here lol.",Nigerian

"Using Verbs after ""him/her"" in Yor√πb√° Using Pronouns after Verbs in Yor√πb√°. Hello, How has the learning been.

I saw her - - Mo r√≠ i We saw him yesterday - - A r√≠ i l√°n√†√°. Ad√© bought it. - - Ade r√† √° Ad√© bought it for me---Ade r√† √° f√∫n mi. Let's go to having him/her after two syllable verbs.

"Call to Action! Things you can do with your wallet to protest the incoming THCA ban This ban is funded by 4 major industries: alcohol, pharmaceuticals, tobacco, and the prison industry. Since these industries are sponsoring taking away our freedoms, we can and will make them lose even more money even if they take away our THC. Step 1: DO NOT buy or consume alcohol including going to bars. Texas businesses like Spec‚Äôs and Total Wine are behind this ban. They want to be able to sell the THC drinks at their liquor stores and profit off of it. The THC drinks alone have made a 15% dent in the Texas alcohol industry and they can‚Äôt stand it. They want to monopolize it and steal the products from the hemp industry. Step 2: DO NOT buy cigarettes, dip, nicotine patches, or nicotine vapes. Big Tobacco is losing money hand over fist from people buying THCA flower and vapes instead of packs of cigarettes. Step 3: DO NOT use pharmaceuticals in place of weed UNLESS you 10000% need it. Try to avoid pharmaceuticals at all costs. Step 4: DO NOT give them ANY reason to put you away in prison for cheap labor. If you buy from a dealer, make sure to drive extremely carefully and GO THE SPEED LIMIT YALL!!!!!! You cannot take away THC and then expect the smokers to hop back into the liquor stores.

A child from a royal lineage will have ""Ad√©"" in the name given, ""if√°, ·ªåÃÄ·π£un will be attached to the name of the child from such background and others.

"Hazel Dickens wrote the song ""Black Lung"" about her brother Thurman, who passed away from the disease in 1963. This tragedy was a formative experience. In honor of all impacted by this disease, we're hosting a benefit concert Sunday, June 1, in Princeton, WV, for Hazel Dickens's 100th Birthday. Black Lung was a very personal cause to the labor country singer Hazel Dickens, who grew up in Montcalm, WV, in a large coal mining family. She wrote the song titled Black Lung in 1969. ‚Äú\[This\] song came from deep personal experience: the trauma of witnessing her brother Thurman die of the affliction, with no funds to pay his medical expenses.‚Äù Many of our people have seen up close the way this horrible disease affects loved ones. A raspy, crackling breath, a never-ending cough, and sometimes coughing up black mucus. In severe cases people suffer from low blood oxygen, where they can have a bluish tint to their lips and fingertips that is a sign of succumbing to the disease. The scarring lung tissue from inhaling coal dust over time, slowly taking the place of air, causing decline in lung function, which can lead to respiratory failure, cardiovascular complications leading to heart failure and other heart related problems, increased susceptibility to infection like tuberculosis and lung cancer, which all can lead to a premature death. Many a time, families have looked on in sorrow as they watch the life leave their loved one's body as a direct result of this disease. This is what happened to Hazel‚Äôs brother Thurman in 1963. ‚ÄúAs \[Hazel\] painfully \[recalled\], ‚ÄòI think watching him die this horrible death really took a toll on me and the way I thought. He was born, lived, and died poor, and didn‚Äôt even have enough to bury himself.‚Äô ‚ÄúHazel‚Äôs performance of this song, received New York Times coverage and won featured exposure on CBS-TV during Walter Cronkite‚Äôs Evening News.‚Äù The 1970s saw a mass movement to safeguard the safety of coal miners facing this terrible disease, led by many of our fathers and grandfathers in coal mining, who fought for a better life for their coworkers and for the next generations in coal mining. Miners and family members who vigorously fought to take up the cause of their loved ones in coal mining delivered incredible gains in the decades that followed. To honor their memory, and the memories of everyone living and passed who were impacted by this disease, it‚Äôs time to take up the cause of our parents and grandparents yet again.

"Question for parents of primary aged kids / primary teachers I‚Äôm curious about what technology/tablets your primary school aged kids are using and what they are using the tablets for during school and homework wise? I‚Äôve got kids in nursery and have tried to keep screen time to pretty much nil but I was quite surprised to hear about how much tech is being given to kids so young once they get into primary. I know not all screen time is created equal and it‚Äôs for educational purposes but what I‚Äôm hearing from other mums (in Glasgow - East Ren anyway) is that pretty much everything is taught on tablets now and lessons are issued and conducted using the tablets that each kids shares/has their own and that jotters are a thing of the past? Are these people exaggerating? How much of your kids schooling is delivered/managed on individual tablets versus using books, pen and paper? FYI I‚Äôm not anti-tech (I work in tech myself) but I was expecting it to be used in a more purposeful way to build certain skills in our new digital world, kind of like what we (I‚Äôm a millennial) had in school with admin, computing, general ICT subjects. Getting them just exposed and used to navigating tablets and apps seems a bit redundant to me considering how intuitively apps are designed these days. It seems a bit mad to me that everyone is alright with primary 1s (for example) being on the tablet most of their waking day to learn instead of using books and paper/pens. Am I missing something?? It just feels quite counter intuitive to all the messaging coming out about screens and concentration / behaviour problems / mental health. It sounds like it‚Äôs a great way for our overworked teachers to manage their lesson plans and marking but is it actually contributing positively to your kid‚Äôs education?

"Are Nigerian Kids Smarter Now ‚Äî or Just More Expensive? I couldn't help but compare the expenses parents now pay for their wards in school with my time as a pupil. Outside tuition fees, the numerous monies that Nigerian private schools demand from parents are something else. These monies appear to be optional, but they are mandatory. This new term, for example, I have paid money for the kids to learn activities (music, swimming, martial arts, etc.), money for Children's Day celebration, money for NIN registration for children. As the term progresses, the school will ask for money for Fruit Week, maybe money for excursion, etc. There is always money for this, money for that. Separated the way the payments are, they look like small change, but when you mentally add all these monies to the school fees, the whole thing becomes very expensive. In my days as a public school pupil, the only money I remember my parents paying‚Äîat the beginning of the term they buy broom, for sweeping the classroom, and cane. Yes, your father will be the one to buy the cane the teacher will use to flog you. I don't know if this still happens in our public schools, but then it was not uncommon to see girls going to school with broom, and boys going to school with cane. We go to school 8am and close 1pm. My kids leave home 7am and come home 4pm. The school books I used as the eldest child, my younger ones used those same books. Nowadays, the books are such that the pupil writes on them so that someone else cannot use them. Parents must buy another copy of the same book for the next child. Are all these changes better for our kids? Are they learning better than we did? With all the activities and excursions, are they more knowledgeable than we were?

Over the past few months, I‚Äôve made some significant improvements to the system, including: * Tone marks for the 10 tones * Vowel length markers * Diphthong and aspiration markers * New glyphs for sounds that weren‚Äôt well represented or weren‚Äôt represented at all, like B, Gb, Th, Dlu, Dlv, X, Die, Dli, Dlo, etc. I‚Äôve got the new glyphs ready in print form, and I‚Äôm currently working on a font that I hope to release in the next few months. This project is really personal for me. Not only do I want to help preserve the Cherokee language, but I also want to be inclusive. As more Cherokee Freedmen reconnect with our African roots‚Äîespecially Yoruba and Igbo‚Äîthere‚Äôs a growing need for a writing system that can reflect that. For example, many of us use the term ‚ÄúObu‚Äù (from Yoruba ‚ÄúOba‚Äù) as a term of endearment, and I want to make sure people can write those connections in the language too. I started this project when I was 10, got serious about it at 18, and now at 26, I‚Äôve put a lot of blood, sweat, and love into this work. Right now, around 100 people (besides myself and the project team) are using the script, and I‚Äôm hoping one day it will be officially adopted by the tribe, or at least recognized. But for now, I just want to get more people using it! I‚Äôm also working on a book that will explain how to use the system, and it will be available for $10.

"If you had the choice to raise your family in Aruba or Saint Martin, which place would you choose? We have the opportunity to move to the Caribbean. We're about to take a trip with our two toddlers to see which place would be the best fit for our family. Right now we're stuck between Saint Martin or Aruba. I'm personally drawn more to Saint Martin. I feel like it has so much to offer as far as adventure and things to do, and it's a short ferry ride to neighboring islands. I like that there's a variety of different cultures and that it has an inactive volcano. But, everyone we've talked to has praised Aruba over Saint Martin profusely. We've also seen a lot of people talk about how safe Aruba is compared to Saint Martin. Apparently the crime has gotten worse in Saint Martin in the last ten or so years and that part does concern me, especially with two toddler girls. So that is my only hang up. If you had the choice to raise your family in Aruba or Saint Martin/Sint Maarten, which place would you choose? Any help or input is appreciated.",Jamaican

"Will Unemployment (TWC) ever contact my new employer? I left my old job back in December of 2024 to start a new position in beginning of 2025. I lasted around 3 months before I was fired. I was able to obtain unemployment benefits and am currently receiving said benefits. On my resume, I decided to leave the last position out, but of course left all prior employment history (up until December 2024). Whenever asked, I gave a reason for leaving other than ""to start a new position."" I then mentioned I left on very good terms, which is true. However, I am starting to worry that if the new employer finds I have claimed for unemployment, either through background check, or contacted by unemployment agency, it would not look good since they could put 2+2 together. From what I researched, finding out via background check is not likely (if even legal), but I don't know if unemployment ever has a reason to contact a new employer. I have found nothing definitive on their website. I will of course be planning to declare my new employment date upon an accepted offer. TIA",Southern US

"traditional Scottish clothing for women Hi everyone! I've watched a lot of videos from tiktok and from my Norwegian bf about the 17th of May (Norway's national day) and been seeing all of the beautiful cultural dresses that Norwegian women wear, and it's got me thinking that for us in Scotland, a country with such rich history and culture, that our traditional clothing, especially for women, is so... non existent?? Whenever I google it, all that comes up is a mix of halloween costume polyester renaissance fair crap, which I have a hard time believing is anything close to accurate. I have come across a very few articles that discuss women's cultural clothing, but for the most part they all come to the conclusion of ""we don't really know what cultural clothing looked like for women with any great certainty"". There is the arisaid, but the few descriptions of this that exist seem to vary a lot depending on area and time, leading to no continuous cultural significance (in my eyes anyway). There's also discourse amongst academics and professionals over how accurate these descriptions even are. There are Scottish tartan businesses that make clothes in tartan patterns - but these aren't cultural in the same way so many other countries wear their traditional clothing. They're just regular clothes in tartan. Anyway, I guess I'm just curious about what all of you think about this? Can we make a pact to create and actual traditional dress for Scottish women that doesn't feed into all the Braveheart fantasy shenanigans? Please? Or maybe I just need to stop googling stuff heheh edit: through all of this googling I've also learnt that whilst tartan has been found in scotland for a long time, the association of tartan to different Clans is largely based on the romanticisation of the Highlands, and the regional differences in tartan is mostly down to different manufacturers in different areas coming up with their own designs. Also the modern kilt being a victorian take on the old ""Great Kilt"" :/ also the thing about the pact was mostly a joke, I'm just ranting about how I wish we had more options on par to other countries",Scottish

"I posted this on tiktok and made a lot of folks mad I'm angry and sad about the entire situation. So many lives lost that could have been prevented. I know, in a perfect world my state wouldn't have voted this way. But I think there is a certain nuance to situations like these that folks who don't live in Appalachia don't understand. I think it comes with so much prejudice towards poor folks that has been hammered into Americans for so long. Folks don't want to acknowledge that there's a system in place keeping the poor down. Keeping education, healthcare, and basic necessities a luxury, so that they keep voting against their own interests. I don't think these folks can comprehend a life where you have to chose between working as a kid to provide for your siblings or going to school. I don't think they can comprehend what it might be like to not be able to read or write as an adult. Kentucky has 37.5% of adults reading between a 3rd and 8th grade level. I don't think they can comprehend that some folks don't even have access to reliable Internet. I see folks making comparison to the LA wildfires and saying they are just ""giving it back"" because folks were saying it was God's judgement to California. That shit wasn't right in the slightest, but you know what the difference is? A lot of folks in LA are wealthy and have somewhere to go. We heard about it for months. There were fundraisers hosted by the NFL and celebrities, but this will be lost in the news cycle within the next couple of days. I see a lot of similarities between this and hurricane Katrina. A lot of those victims were simply forgotten and blamed because they were poor and lived in a red state. But they didn't deserve it. They didn't vote for that. Sorry for the long rant but I long for the day when folks can see Appalachia for the beautiful and complex place that it is, instead of using it as a scapegoat to ignore their own prejudice and hate towards the less fortunate and disenfranchised. I know there are many hateful Appalachians but like everywhere in the world the good folks always outweigh the bad. The revolution is going to have folks from all walks of life.

"r/Nigeria Community Rules Update. PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING AND COMMENTING. Sequel to the two previous posts and regarding the state of the subreddit, this post will contain the new and updated community rules. Kindly read this thread before posting, especially if you are a new user. You can check the results of the votes cast #Based on what you voted, 5 of the new rules are as follows: 1. If you post a link to a news article, you must follow up with a comment about your thoughts regarding the content of the news article you just posted. **Exceptions will only be made for important breaking news articles.** The point of this rule is to reduce and/or eliminate the number of bots and users who just spam the sub with links to news articles, and to also make sure this sub isn't just overrun with news articles. **ADDITIONALLY:** If you post images and videos that contain or make reference to data, a piece of information or an excerpt from a news piece, kindly add a source in the comments or your post will be removed. 2. Posts from blog and tabloid websites that deal with gossip and sensationalized pieces, e.g., Linda Ikeji Blog, Instablog, etc. will no longer be allowed except in special cases. 3. There will be no limit on the number of posts a user can make in a day. However, if the moderators notice that you are making too many posts that flood the sub and make it look like you are spamming, your posts may still be removed. 4. The Weeky Discussion thread will be brought back in due time. 5. You can make posts promoting your art projects, music, film, documentary, or any other relevant personal projects as long as you are a Nigerian and/or they are in some way related to Nigeria. However, posts that solicit funds, link to shady websites, or pass as blatant advertising will be removed. If you believe your case is an exception, you can reach out to the moderators. _____ #CLARIFICATION/MODIFICATION OF OTHER RULES: **1. ETHNORELIGIOUS BIGOTRY:** Comments/submissions promoting this will be removed, repeat offenders will be banned, and derailed threads will be locked. This includes but is not limited to malicious ethnic stereotypes, misinformation, islamophobia, anti-Igbo sentiment, and so on. Hence posts such as *""Who was responsible for the Civil War?""* or *""would Nigeria be better without the north?""* which are usually dogwhistles for bigots are not allowed. This community is meant for any and all Nigerians regardless of their religious beliefs or ethnicity. **2. THE LGBTQIA+ COMMUNITY:** As the sidebar reads, this is a safe space for LGBTQIA+ Nigerians. Their rights and existence are not up for debate under any condition. Hence, kindly do not ask questions like *""what do Nigerians think about the LGBT community""* or anything similar as it usually attracts bigots. Comments/submissions encouraging or directing hatred towards them will be removed, and repeat offenders will be banned. **3. SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENDER:** Comments/submissions promoting this will be removed, repeat offenders will be banned, and derailed threads will be locked. This includes using gendered slurs, sexist stereotypes, and making misogynistic remarks. Rape apologism, victim blaming, trivializing sexual harassment or joking over the experiences of male survivors of sexual abuse etc will also get you banned. Do not post revenge porn, leaked nudes, and leaked sex tapes. **4. RACISM AND ANTI-BLACKNESS:** Comments/submissions promoting this will be removed, repeat offenders will be banned, and derailed threads will be locked. This includes but is not limited to colourism, white supremacist rhetoric, portraying black men - or black people in general - as thugs and any other malicious racial stereotype. **5. MISINFORMATION:** Kindly verify anything before you post, or else your post will be removed. It is best to stick to verifiable news outlets and sources. As was said earlier, images and videos that contain data, information, or an excerpt from a news piece must be posted with a link to the source in the comments, or they will be removed. **6. LOW-EFFORT CONTENT:** Do your best to add a body of text to your text posts. This will help other users be able to get the needed context and extra information before responding or starting discussions. Your posts may be removed if they have little or no connection to Nigeria. **7. SENSATIONALIZED AND INCENDIARY SUBMISSIONS:** Consistently posting content meant to antagonize, stigmatize, derail, or misinform will get you banned. This is not a community for trolls and instigators. **8. CODE OF CONDUCT FOR NON-NIGERIANS AND NON-BLACK PARTICIPANTS IN THIS COMMUNITY:** Remember that this is first and foremost a community for Nigerians. If you are not a Nigerian, kindly do not speak over Nigerians and do not make disparaging remarks about Nigeria or Nigerians, or else you will be banned. And given the current and historical context with respect to racial dynamics, this rule applies even more strictly to white people who participate here. Be respectful of Nigeria and to Nigerians. **9. HARRASSMENT:** Kindly desist from harrassing other users. Comments or posts found to be maliciously targetting other community members will get you banned. **10. META POSTS:** If you feel you have something to say about how this subreddit is run or you simply have suggestions, you can make a post about it. _____ #BANNABLE OFFENCES Repeat offenders for any of the aforementioned bannable offences will get a 1st time ban of 2 days. The 2nd time offenders will get 7-day bans, and 3rd time offenders will get 14-day bans. After your 3rd ban, if you continue breaking the rules, you will likely be permanently banned. However, you can appeal your permanent ban if you feel like you've had a change of heart. Instant and permanent bans will only be handed out in the following cases: 1. Spam 2. Doxxing 3. Life-threatening remarks directed at other users 4. Covert or Blatant Racism 5. Non-consensual sexual images 6. Trolling and derailment by accounts found to be non-Nigerian _____ All of these rules will be added to the sidebar soon enough for easy access. If you have any questions, contributions, or complaints regarding these new rules, kindly bring them up in the comments section. _____ cc: u/Bobelle, u/timoleo, u/sanders2020dubai",Nigerian

"Daddy's legacy pt.2 I mentioned my dad's masonry work in the last post, but I couldn't edit it to add these photos. This was all done by hand with multiple colors of concrete. It's not real rock, so I guess not quite stucco. These are just the examples I see daily in my mom's house. The inside picture was a fireplace for a small propane heater, with the cedar mantle. Under the ""stucco"" that's on the outside is a foundation made of 12 inch block that I laid. He had two men working for him, and once I got started he sent them home. I moved more, faster, and better. That was one of his favorite stories about me to tell people. Along with my bass playing and rifle skills, but those are different stories. Anyways, enjoy these samples. Note the brick on top of the mantle; his cousin had two made for me and my mom. His name and life dates. I couldn't help but laugh when we got it in the mail, cause we joked it was heavy as a sack of bricks. After opening it, the first thing that popped into my head was the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia clip... ""May I offer you a brick in this trying time?""",Southern US
"Best island for young kids Feb/March next year we are looking to possibly vacation to the Caribbean for a week with my brother and his family. We've cruised to a few destinations, but never stayed on any of the islands. Looking for somewhere that has safe beaches for toddlers, as well as snorkeling that an 8 and 10yo can handle. There will be 10 of us traveling together. 5 adults (one hoping to be pregnant) and 5 kids ages 10, 8, 4.5, 4, and barely 2. I know ""affordable"" looks different for everyone, but not looking to go to the most expensive place out there! Willing to rent cars, but we want to be on or walkable to a beach or excellent pool. Doesn't need to be all inclusive. Open to any suggestions!",Jamaican
