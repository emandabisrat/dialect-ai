"How is Jamaica Doing These Days With Ultra-processed Food? Didn't grow up in Jamaica, but my family is from there. One thing I've always loved about it is that the people always seem to avoid too much ultra-processed food (aside from KFC). Is it still like that? Or is it gradually changing? Haven't been back in a while, but feel like they could be an excellent model for the rest of the world in terms of dietary habits.",Jamaican

"Jamaica‚Äôs fashion industry seems underdeveloped - am I wrong? Jamaica is developing so fast with real estate, restaurants, hotels, etc and it‚Äôs so exciting to see. But I can‚Äôt help but wonder‚Ä¶ why hasn‚Äôt the fashion and e-commerce industry grown in the same way? I‚Äôm not talking about boutiques or market stalls scattered across the island. I mean a real, established fashion brand that almost becomes the go-to destination islandwide (for whichever target audience). Like how PrettyLittleThing dominates in the UK or Fashion Nova in the US. I‚Äôm genuinely curious‚Ä¶ could Jamaica benefit from something like that? Is this something people even want, or would they just prefer more international brand presence on the island instead (which I‚Äôd also love to see, to be fair)? Would love to hear your honest thoughts.",Jamaican

"If All Politicians Are the Same, Why Bother to Vote?"" Here in Jamaica, we‚Äôve got two main political parties, and for many of us, it feels like both sides play the same game‚Äîpromises, problems, and little progress. It‚Äôs easy to ask: ‚ÄúIf nothing really changes, why should I vote?‚Äù But here‚Äôs the flip side: if you don‚Äôt vote, you lose your say. The people who show up to the polls are the ones shaping the future, even if it‚Äôs not the future you wanted. So what do we do when we feel politically stuck? Do we vote for the lesser evil? Do we demand better candidates? Do we spoil our ballots in protest? Do we organize beyond the ballot box?

"Afro-Jamaican spirituality? Hey there. Please be patient with me, I am very new to this and not very educated. Recently I have felt a calling to explore different religions/spirituality. Both of my parents were born and raised in Jamaica, but moved to America to have me. I was raised super Christian, but would love to learn about African spirituality, specifically in Jamaica. My family is not open to discussing this with me, as they believe it is ‚Äúevil‚Äù. I‚Äôve particularly been interested in learning about Kumina, but there is such little information about it out there. I feel drawn to Jamaican history, as that is where my people come from, and I know very little about my ancestors. I just want to learn, and be less closed minded. Would you consider Kumina to be a ‚Äúreligion‚Äù? Is it something I can begin to practice at home? If so, what are some small spiritual things I can do to push me in the right direction? Is it like other African spiritualities, where I can get a ‚Äúreading‚Äù from a religious official? What deities are present in Kumina? How could I learn/connect more? Do you have any good resources for learning about Afro-Jamaican spirituality?? Any and all information is welcome! Thanks for reading, and thank you in advance.",Jamaican

A university student was recently kidnapped and has been missing. A 9 year old was unalived and graped by a man who had been in jail for breaking both arms of another young girl.

When: Feb - March time frame Reliable WiFi and power - this is one of the reasons I‚Äôm looking outside of PR. The power and WiFi situation can be sketchy (not in all areas but many). I‚Äôm not taking the time off so I need to be able to work and have video calls.

"Relocation after a hurricane So the rainy season has officially begun, and with that hurricanes. In the event your island was hit with a category 4 or 5.

"If you had the choice to raise your family in Aruba or Saint Martin, which place would you choose? We have the opportunity to move to the Caribbean. We're about to take a trip with our two toddlers to see which place would be the best fit for our family. Right now we're stuck between Saint Martin or Aruba. I'm personally drawn more to Saint Martin. I feel like it has so much to offer as far as adventure and things to do, and it's a short ferry ride to neighboring islands. I like that there's a variety of different cultures and that it has an inactive volcano. But, everyone we've talked to has praised Aruba over Saint Martin profusely. We've also seen a lot of people talk about how safe Aruba is compared to Saint Martin. Apparently the crime has gotten worse in Saint Martin in the last ten or so years and that part does concern me, especially with two toddler girls. So that is my only hang up.

"Stop shipping back your kids I was sent to Ghana for nine years. And guess what? I still can‚Äôt speak my native tongue properly. I didn‚Äôt fit in there, and I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone. I was always a quiet kid, and everyone thought they could ‚Äúforce‚Äù the quietness out of me ‚Äî but it never worked. Maybe I‚Äôm neurodivergent, maybe I just didn‚Äôt fit in socially. But forcing me into an environment like that made it worse, not better. I stood out even after nine years. I never fully felt like I belonged there, and people could still tell I wasn‚Äôt originally from Ghana. So what exactly did it fix? Nothing. I‚Äôm not even saying you shouldn‚Äôt let your child learn about their roots ‚Äî of course it‚Äôs good for a child to understand their heritage. But please, do not confuse cultural exposure with punishment. You want them to connect with their identity? ‚Ä¢ Send them on holiday to visit family. ‚Ä¢ Let them stay for a year in a safe, loving environment ‚Äî not a strict institution. ‚Ä¢ Speak your native tongue to them at home. ‚Ä¢ Let them read books, watch African shows, talk to elders. ‚Ä¢ Actually educate them ‚Äî don‚Äôt abandon them. Because sending your kid straight from the UK to a boarding school in Africa ‚Äî especially when they didn‚Äôt see it coming ‚Äî is cruel. Some of those schools feel like prison camps. The caning, the early wake-ups, the isolation. It doesn‚Äôt build character. It breaks it. In my case, I wasn‚Äôt even misbehaving. It was just about ‚Äúlearning culture.‚Äù But nine years? You can‚Äôt tell me that‚Äôs necessary. They could‚Äôve cut it short. They could‚Äôve done better. So I‚Äôm saying this clearly: Stop sending your kids to boarding schools in Africa as a solution. Stop lying to them about it. Stop calling it ‚Äúdiscipline.‚Äù Stop using culture as a cover for cruelty. If your child is struggling with behavior or you‚Äôre scared they‚Äôre heading toward danger ‚Äî do your job as a parent. Get therapy. Talk to a school counselor. Go to youth support services. Involve junior police programs if you must. But do not abandon your child because parenting became hard. If you‚Äôre not ready to deal with the worst sides of parenting, you shouldn‚Äôt be a parent.

"My Brother's Scholarship to Finland üá´üáÆ- 9 months UPDATE. Hello Reddit family, It‚Äôs been a while since our last update ‚Äî almost 8 months now ‚Äî and we felt it was time to share how the experience has been. A lot has happened since then ‚Äî the good, the bad, and the real‚Äîand we‚Äôre grateful to still be here, growing, learning, and adapting. First, we want to say a big thank you to everyone who supported us the last time we shared our story. Your kindness, advice, encouragement, and even support meant more than you can imagine. We never left this group ‚Äî we‚Äôve just been deep in the thick of the experience, trying to stay afloat and achieve something meaningful. Living in Finland has been a blend of beauty, struggle, growth, and resilience. My brother has now been here for nearly 9 months, and while the road hasn‚Äôt been easy, it‚Äôs been deeply transformative. The Winter Challenge Coming from Nigeria, a warm country, nothing could have prepared him for the Finnish winter. Temperatures dropped to -17 and sometimes to -23¬∞C, and there were days he had to walk long distances with frozen feet and numb fingers ‚Äîtrying to reach school when his bus pass has expired or in search of job opportunities. It is tough, sometimes even surreal, but he‚Äôs adapted more than we ever thought possible. And surprisingly, he says he‚Äôs come to enjoy the cold ‚Äî it builds something in you, he says. The Job Hunt This remains the hardest part. Despite applying for over 150 jobs, attending multiple interviews, and visiting offices in person, the results have been the same: ""No openings"" It‚Äôs discouraging, yes, but he hasn‚Äôt let it break him. He‚Äôs still pushing, still learning the language slowly, and still showing up. At one point, he made a heartfelt post in a local Facebook group about needing a job. That post ended up going viral. A lot people at his school and local community saw it. Teachers came up to him to check on him and offered words of encouragement. People understood. They knew how hard things are, and they showed compassion. A complete stranger ‚Äî a Finnish person ‚Äî even sent him a ‚Ç¨50 gift card to buy food during Ramadan as a result of the Facebook post. That meant so much, especially at a time when he had nothing. It‚Äôs wild how one post asking for help can bring out so much love from people you‚Äôve never met. The job situation in Finland right now is tough‚Äînot just for newcomers like my brother, but even for Finnish citizens. We‚Äôve come across people who‚Äôve had their working hours cut so companies can spread the limited hours across more employees. It‚Äôs a way to help more people earn something, but it also shows how serious the unemployment issue is. So it‚Äôs not just him‚Äîit‚Äôs a nationwide challenge, and even locals are feeling the pressure. Hopefully, things improve soon for everyone. The Silver Lining: School and Support Where things have been difficult on one side, they‚Äôve been incredibly fulfilling on another. He‚Äôs studying mechanical welding at his vocational school, and it‚Äôs something he‚Äôs truly passionate about.‚Äî working with machines, cutting, measuring, practicing all kinds of welding techniques: stick, MIG/MAG, TIG. He‚Äôs already done multiple fabrication projects, like building a miniature stainless steel wind turbine (which he‚Äôs really proud of), and he‚Äôs learning to use CNC and bending machines. Another fulfilling projects he worked on was making a recoil hammer. It looked simple, but it taught him a lot. He had to machine three metal rods, cut them into four parts, add a grip, and assemble them according to given dimensions. No step-by-step instructions ‚Äî just the parts and a drawing. Seeing it come together with his own hands was a real confidence booster. It‚Äôs intense and hands-on, and even though he still needs a lot of practice, he‚Äôs excited about how far he‚Äôs come and everything he‚Äôs learned in just one year. He‚Äôs grateful to be there, and he‚Äôs looking forward to having an even better and more productive second year as his first year wraps up. We've also put together a short video montage to give a better sense of what he‚Äôs been up to ‚Äî snowy walks to school, hands-on training, his projects, and the general vibe of life there. Finland is cold, but beautiful in its own way. And watching him adapt to it has been incredible. The video adds some context and shows the kind of growth that words alone can‚Äôt capture. One thing we didn‚Äôt expect ‚Äî but are so grateful for ‚Äî is the level of support he‚Äôs received from fellow Nigerians in Finland. People from all over ‚Äî Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba, Muslim, Christian ‚Äî have shown up for him in big ways. Nigerians have this incredible ability to form community wherever they are, and my brother has seen the best of that. Especially from the local Muslim and Yoruba communities, who have helped with food, rent, and even job referrals. It‚Äôs been proof that Nigerians are a force for good all around the world. Unfortunately, we sometimes get a bad rap because of a few bad eggs, and yes, there‚Äôs discrimination here and there. But overwhelmingly, the love he‚Äôs received from fellow Nigerians has been genuine and unconditional. And that has made a world of difference. Still Standing, Still Hoping We won‚Äôt pretend everything is perfect. He still doesn‚Äôt have a job, he‚Äôs behind on some rent, and recently got a notice from a debt collection agency regarding school-related materials. We're sharing this not to complain, but to give an honest picture of the journey so far. It hasn't been easy, but he's still here ‚Äî learning, growing, and doing his best to keep moving forward. And we believe better days are ahead. Finland is still a wonderful country ‚Äî safe, peaceful, full of kind people and great systems. The struggle right now doesn‚Äôt change that. It‚Äôs just part of the path, and we believe this path will eventually lead to something great. Thanks again to everyone who‚Äôs been supporting him ‚Äî here on Reddit, on Facebook, or in real life. Every kind word, every piece of advice, every bit of encouragement has meant something. We don‚Äôt take it lightly. Here‚Äôs to surviving year one ‚Äî and hopefully, thriving in year two. üí™üèΩ With love, Saheed & Brother",Nigerian
"Enough with the pot bellies I‚Äôm actually going to start calling attention to how visibly discomforting seeing men with those massive oversized bellies with dropping chests is. Outside of making all those men look weak, it‚Äôs undignified to carry around that belly in public. Ignoring the appearance, the cause is even worse. Men eating four meals or more in the day with each being full of oil, rice, and poultry. No nutrition, all fat, spice, and oil. Men with bellies like that are constantly looking for food all the time. No time to think about sharing the food available with others, no time to think about how much you‚Äôre eating, only time to gorge and drink. Obesity related deaths account for the highest portion of premature casualties (especially among adult men) and no one is calling attention to how bad the situation is getting.",Nigerian

"Justice for Hamdiya Reading about the recent kidnap and attempt ed murder of Hamdiya Sidi-Ali sent chills through my spine, a teenager going through such inhuman treatment because she dared to speak truth to power, betrayed by a governor whose responsibility it is to ensure the security of the lives and property of the good people of Sokoto state, betrayed by the police whose constitutional role it is to police the society and protect the citizens from any form of harm, betrayed by a society that won't stand up enmass against injustice. It's so painful that she and her loved ones alone had to go through this, the people she fights for do not know their left from their right, they all sit cowardly and watch while the ruling elites abuse power and pilfer the state's resources, and then, criticize the one who dared to speak up on behalf of the masses. Who are we exactly? This is just one case out of many, where some DISSIDENTS have been used as scape-goat to deter any form of accountability demand, by the leadership of this country. It however makes me wonder how much longer we would have to continue like this in a so-called democratic system. Our leaders believe in democracy when it comes to defending and protecting their rights to be in office, but when it comes to upholding the rule of law while discharging their constitutional role, they vehemently throw aside the democratic rhetorics, revealing the ugly dictator in them. Maybe the leadership is truly a reflection of who we are as a people, and perhaps right it is. Hamdiya got picked up, drugged, and left to die in an unknown location. Luckily for her, she was found and taken to the hospital. For what exactly?... Because she relentlessly, despite her haven being persecuted in the past, continued to criticize the leadership of Sokoto state, demanding for good governance to the people. If the people of Sokoto state still cannot see that their leadership is their true enemy by this acts, then they truly deserve the worst they're yet to experience. I just cannot fathom the rationale behind a seating governor using the instrument of the police and the judiciary to persecute a teenage girl. I'm so gutted right now, and wish for speedy justice for Hamdiya. I call upon the governor to append his resignation, the inspector general of police to punish and resind the batches of those police officers directly involved in this case. I call on the good people of Sokoto state, to rally enmass on the street of Sokoto shouting, raising placards, demanding for justice. This is not only about Hamdiya, it's a punitive call to end the persecution of people who criticize government. Nigerians need to start standing for each other against the true enemies of the state.",Nigerian
"$67.5M Lost to Denied Visas: Is the West Punishing Poorer African Nations? In 2024 alone, African countries lost a staggering $67.5 million to denied visa applications to Europe. Let that sink in: **we're literally paying to be rejected.** A new report shows that rejection rates remain disproportionately high for African nations, especially the poorer ones. Countries like **Ghana, Senegal, and Nigeria** face rejection rates of **40‚Äì50%**, yet each application costs upwards of $100 in non-refundable fees. To make it worse, the trend hasn't changed from 2023 - in fact, it's *gotten worse*. The poorer the country, the more likely your visa gets denied. And no, they don‚Äôt even have to give you a reason. This isn't just about travel. It's about opportunity, dignity, and the blatant gatekeeping of the global north. Why are we still paying into a system that seems designed to say **no** to us? Some questions for discussion: * Should African governments start demanding **reciprocal visa fees or refund policies**? * How can we hold these embassies accountable for such a rigged system? * Should there be a **continental response or boycott** to these visa injustices? Let's talk. Because if you ask me, $67.5 million could‚Äôve gone to building something real - not into the pockets of rejection machines.",Nigerian

Am I being overdramatic? So me and my father do not have a good relationship at all I hold a lot of resentment for him for the way he‚Äôs treated me and I fear him a lot bc he would beat me when I was younger as well as the fact he isn‚Äôt someone I feel I can really talk to about my problems because he often makes me feel bad about them such as I told him I‚Äôm doing a gap year to reapply to medicine and he first asked what would I do if I don‚Äôt get in the second time which I‚Äôve given some thought about ofc but wasn‚Äôt really hoping to hear that from him. If I‚Äôm being honest my resentment towards him stems from the beatings i received as a child which I do not believe was justified. My first memory of him was him scraping the flesh off my skin when I got a temporary tattoo from a yogurt maybe when I was 4 or 5. I told him this because he‚Äôs asked why I fear him now even though he doesn‚Äôt hit me anymore which I believe is because I now defend myself he said it‚Äôs discipline and that it‚Äôs legal. Please tell me if I‚Äôm being overdramatic about this bc ik it‚Äôs common in Nigeria culture to beat your kids but I wasn‚Äôt raised in Nigeria and i believe physical harm does no good however I‚Äôve seen other posts that say their father beat them and it made them respect him after awhile when they grew up my father said the same thing about his dad I‚Äôm 18 right now but I‚Äôm not feeling that way so I‚Äôd like to know other peoples opinions Edit: also I‚Äôd like to mention that whenever we get into arguments and I say nasty stuff he brings up that hes done everything for me raised me etc and that he doesn‚Äôt deserve this and because of this I often feel bad that I don‚Äôt like him that much,Nigerian

"We really need to document our TFR and population properly. We are completely relying on foreign organizations for the data, and most of their figures are purely estimates. Nigeria's TFR in 2013 was estimated to be around 5.74 children per woman. This fell to around 4.48 in 2023, 10 years later. These are the figures from 2013‚Äì2023: 5.74, 5.66, 5.62, 5.58, 5.52, 5.45, 5.38, 5.31, 4.64, 4.48. This means that the total decrease over 10 years = 5.74 - 4.48 = 1.26, or an average of 0.126 per year. Here is the problem with this data: if you look closely, the TFR or at least the recorded TFR barely dropped over the years until the UNICEF MICS survey was conducted. Then it found that our TFR was significantly lower than what was actually recorded. To put this into context, if the rate of 0.126 per year is constant meaning that it doesn't drop or increase any faster‚Äîthis would be our TFR over the decades: * 2030s (average year 2035): 4.48 - (0.126 √ó 12) = 4.48 - 1.512 = 2.97 * 2040s (average year 2045): 2.97 - (0.126 √ó 10) = 2.97 - 1.26 = 1.71 * 2050s (average year 2055): 1.71 - (0.126 √ó 10) = 1.71 - 1.26 = 0.45 * 2060s (average year 2065): 0.45 - (0.126 √ó 10) = 0.45 - 1.26 = -0.81 (capped at 0, as TFR cannot be negative). What makes this even more concerning is that the Federal Government is incompetent and doesn't accurately record data, meaning that we have to rely on predictions and estimations from world organizations. For example, the prediction from the UN for 2023 was 4.48 children per woman, but that TFR is completely wrong since the TFR recorded by UNICEF during the MICS survey in 2021 was 4.6. We really need to be sure about this data, or we will face a massive crisis in the future one without any solution. The next MICS survey will be either this year or next year, and that will tell us how our TFR is doing whether it has stabilized or fallen even further. But if we see as big of a drop between 2021 and 2026 as we saw from 2017 to 2021, then the Federal Government will have to start taking immediate action. That would mean we will likely never reach 400 million in population, and that our demographic dividend is a lot closer than we ever thought.",Nigerian
"Looking for an estranged family members Good day to you all. My grandmother was the last child of her family before her Yoruba father abandoned her and moved back to his state, Lagos. He left my grandmother with her Fulani Mother and his other son (Duro) in Kano. He got remarried and barely visited her and she didn‚Äôt want to have anything to do with him although her brother didn‚Äôt have the same approach. He stayed very close to him, visiting him every weekend he got. He eventually passed away before my grandmother got married, she didn‚Äôt want to go to his funeral because he was a wealthy man and she had the tribalistic notion that Yoruba people can curse you for inheritance. But as we all know that didn‚Äôt stop her brother. Her half brother (Kayodele, I believe) reached out to her but he shortly died thereafter.

"Views of racism by skin colour NB Please also read the EDIT below ..... Original Post: Im from Europe and wanted to ask views of people from Africa, I tend to read the Nigerian subreddit a good bit so Im posting here...not just the Nigerian subreddit I do some 'travelling' to other subreddits ha. I think people would agree that every country has an element of racism. Others may disagree on the following view but in my own view it's a by-product of community ie the 'us v them' attitude that a community can have. When people are together there is always 'another'. I have a recent vague theory, which is based on little fact. My theory is that white and black people tend to the most racist. The reason that may be the case is because we have the most 'extreme' skin colours and therefore have a greater tendency to form the 'other' in our minds. It could be my imagination but for instance I seem to have noticed that latinos, who would have a greater tendancy to have brown or olive (or whatever you want to term it) skin tone so a mix, tend to discuss or consider skin colour less? On reddit forums but also from travelling there too. Or maybe this is all just my imagination. I'm not here to have a go at white or black people just my thoughts which is based on little fact. EDIT: Im seeing comments that white people have been and continue to be the ones doing the discrimination, not black people. Which is correct. HOWEVER countries with lighter skin hold the power. There are historic reasons why I think that is the case (ultimately I think it boils down to the North being colder - for instance, need for oil, gas, housing etc, which has meant that the North has had to put a more complex system in place for this.

"We all can't be right ‚ÄéI got myself caught up in a discussion with a lady on Twitter over some religious matters; me being Muslim, and she Christian. ‚Äé ‚ÄéUnderstandably, she had some opinions regarding Islam, which, after I had seen them, I thought to educate her on why her thoughts might be misconceived and wrong. We got talking, and no matter how much I tried to make her see that her views were black and white, not necessarily following the machination of the Almighty's way of doing things ‚Äì as we humans love to judge God's actions through our limited human lenses ‚Äì this lady wouldn't budge. ‚Äé ‚ÄéShe was persistent, firm in what she was saying, claiming it to be the truth, whilst disregarding anything that doesn't weave into her psychology and narrative. She was blantantly adamant, dismissive, and frankly, I don't blame her. It's her belief, who was I to hold her against it? ‚Äé ‚ÄéAfterall, we could argue on this religion thing from now till the world goes boom! and both of us may not even see the light of God, talk more of entering Paradise. ‚Äé ‚ÄéBut honestly, I would have loved her to see that, ideally, two truths can have room to coexist, no matter how distinct they are from one another. I have my own truths, things that make up my own belief system ‚Äì narratives that I have cross-checked, read, and researched upon to have arrived at them. ‚Äé ‚ÄéAnd I am proud to wear it on me like a badge. ‚Äé ‚ÄéHaving someone come out of nowhere to say that my perspective and idealogy is wrong, bad, and outrightly false, even after giving you points and reasons on how I have come to this, speaks on the person's level of intellect and perception. ‚Äé ‚ÄéIn hindsight, I had commended her for reading up so much about the religion, but sadly, I could see how narrow and biased ‚Äì especially that last one ‚Äì her views about Islam was. Can you imagine that she refuted and refused that Islam is part of the three original Abrahamic religions? And in spite of my arguments against such thought process, stating how it's almost impossible to extricate Islam from among the Abrahamic religions, she still refused to acknowledge it! ‚Äé ‚ÄéA religious pseudo-intellectual in one corner of Africa thinks that Islam doesn't have what it takes to be counted as one of the Abrahamic religions! If that doesn't scream bias and hate and craziness, I don't know what does. ‚Äé ‚ÄéIt was confounding to read that from her, amongst many other things that I read from her two days ago. After reading through her comments carefully, all of it, I just shook my head and concluded that there was nothing I could say that would change this one's mind. Her bias had taken root into her psyche, and there was no way of pulling her out. ‚Äé ‚ÄéWell, all these didn't vex me that much ‚Äì I have met many like her, though not as stubborn ‚Äì what had really riled me up the most was her not replying my messages after all I had sent her! And I had sent her a whole lot, hoping it might soften her bias a little bit. ‚Äé ‚ÄéHer argument was that my points were baseless and lacked any real justification to the things she believes Islam is lacking. And so, she couldn't bother replying my messages. She even added that she wasn't expecting any credible points from me, as many of it would be steeped in blind defense of my religion and would lack any form of intellectual congruity. ‚Äé ‚ÄéEven after that show of arrogance, I still tried to nudge her heavily-biased, steel-like thinking to a more liberal corner, and yet...nothing. That was when I got my cue to let her be. ‚Äé ‚ÄéI was wrong, and to think I saw her as an intelligent person. ‚Äé ‚ÄéP.S; If you have any view about Islam, and you're not willing to learn but to assert your views on me, I beg you in whatever you believe in, keep it to yourself. I don't have strength this evening.",Nigerian

I've been able to earn some decent crypto rewards by participating in the game's events and challenges. One thing that stands out about Akarun is its focus on community building. The developers are actively engaged with the community, and the feedback loop is impressive. It's clear that they're committed to making the game better and more enjoyable for players. Of course, as with any crypto project, there are risks involved. The market can be volatile, and the value of the rewards can fluctuate. However, I believe that Akarun has a strong foundation and a clear vision for the future. Overall, I'd say that Akarun is definitely worth checking out, especially if you're interested in crypto gaming. The community is friendly, the gameplay is fun, and the rewards are worth the effort. Give it a try and see what you think! I've been asked a few questions about how to get started with Akarun, so I'll add a quick guide here.

"Why are Nigerians quick to dismiss or downplay the achievements of other Nigerians, especially when compared to their International Counterparts? Obviously, not every Nigerian does this, but it's common enough to be a problem. A while back, I saw people talking about how Nigerian billionaires aren't anything impressive compared to billionaires in other countries and how all their wealth was solely created through government contracts. I have also heard takes like ""Nigerian billionaires and the companies especially banks don't contribute to jobs or wealth creation in the country,"" or takes like ""No Nigerian CEO can be headhunted by Western corporations."" And it's not just businessmen. This rhetoric is also pushed onto educated people, ministers, etc. I think we associate an English accent with being well-learned, which is silly and self-hating. But above everything, this is so hypocritical considering how Nigerians whine on a daily basis about how Nigeria is so lawless and not a ""sane climate,"" and how it holds them back. But somehow, this criticism isn't extended to people like this. To top it all off, the people who always push these criticisms aren't even successful founders themselves, but random people not even related to the industry they criticize. Now, I'm not trying to say Nigerian elites are blameless or innocent, but I find it funny when people are suddenly fine with elites in other countries (who do the same shit, or even worse) but absolutely despise our home-grown elites.",Nigerian

"Nigeria might be better off with natural disasters I actually believe in environmental eugenics. The reason why we have so many stupid leaders and a stupid population is that we don‚Äôt have the seasons or natural disasters to wipe out people who waste resources. The best we have is flood and traffic and that can be mitigating by owning an SUV. I wish we had earthquakes, tsunamis and tornadoes that made planes impossible to fly so that our leaders would be stuck there. If they like they can drive 100 cars in their convoy, if a tsunami happens and they looted the funds for adequate drainage and infrastructure they would be swept away too. Our climate is too nice, nothing ever happens, you can technically live in a mudhut for centuries and only storms here and there might mildly inconvenience you. We also never had the need to build mega structures that could withstand the cold winters. All these things led to certain personality types thriving rather than being killed off, people like Tinubus ancestors would‚Äôve died in winter since, he probably wouldn‚Äôt even exist. Boko haram would‚Äôve frozen to death in sambisa Forrest then their heads would‚Äôve cleared.

"How I quietly fixed my USDT-to-Naira stress ‚Äî and ended up building something better Hi all, I‚Äôm sharing this because I know many Nigerians are in the same boat I was in a few months ago‚Äîstruggling with the back-and-forth of converting crypto (especially USDT) to Naira smoothly. If you‚Äôve ever been ghosted on a P2P trade, received a fake alert, or waited two hours for a payment that never came‚Äîyou know how tiring it can get. I went through that cycle more times than I care to admit. Eventually, I got fed up and decided to do something about it. Along with a few others, I built a tool that I now use myself: it allows you to convert stablecoins like USDT directly to Naira **without going through P2P at all**. * The money lands in your wallet (or bank) in less than 30 seconds * It works with other coins too: USDC, BTC, ETH, BNB, etc. * No haggling, no middlemen, no drama * You can also spend or send directly from inside the app We made it simple on purpose. No pop-ups. No ads. No trading noise. It‚Äôs been quietly running for about 5 months now. The rates are usually better than P2P platforms I used to rely on (Binance, Kucoin, etc), and the peace of mind has honestly been worth more than anything. It‚Äôs called **Mular**, and it‚Äôs available on both the Google Play and Apple App Store. **To be clear‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt an ad.** I'm one of the co-founders, yes, but I‚Äôm also just a regular user who was tired of the usual P2P runaround. If you're curious, I‚Äôm happy to answer questions, share how it works, or point you to the app privately. **Why I‚Äôm Sharing This:** 1. **Transparency**: As a co-founder, I want honest feedback from real users 2. **Pain Points**: We built this specifically for Nigerian crypto users‚Äô needs 3. **Community**: I‚Äôm active here and happy to discuss crypto/fintech in Nigeria If you‚Äôve been looking for a smoother crypto-to-Naira solution, or have better ones you already use, feel free to drop your experience below too.

"My experience travelling to Lagos after a long while and with an expired passport I thought I would make this post to be helpful perhaps to others and to share my experience travelling to Lagos with an expired Nigerian passport. Context I hadn‚Äôt been back to Lagos in over 10 years, and I was a child when I last went. One of my parents is Nigerian, but I was raised in Europe. My primary reason for travelling was to reconnect with my cousins. However, I‚Äôd also been talking to someone romantically and thought this trip would be a great chance to meet them in person as well. \*Travelling\* I was able to board my flight using my expired Nigerian passport. For reference, I flew with Lufthansa, and the flight itself was smooth, with no delays. However, once I arrived at Nigerian immigration, the official seemed quite perturbed that my passport had been expired for so long (it had expired in 2014 lol). I did panic at first but I realised that the official was flirting with me and then he asked for my number. Once I gave it to him, he let me through without any issues. It was one of the odder encounters of my trip, but I soon realised that men in Nigeria tend to be much more forward. If they find you attractive, they won‚Äôt hesitate to let you know lol. If you‚Äôre a solo female traveler, be prepared for some unwanted attention at times. That said, I was able to retrieve my bags smoothly and headed to the pick-up area. On my way out, I was approached by several people offering their services, as is common at the airport. You don‚Äôt have to give them money, but some may assist you with a trolley for your bags and it is generally expected that you tip them. \*My experience of Nigeria in general as a woman travelling solo\* Having not been back to Nigeria for over a decade, my memories were faint. However, I noticed significant changes, especially at the airport, which was much more modern than I remembered. Overall, my experience as a woman traveling solo felt quite different this time around. One thing that stood out was the sheer amount of attention I received. It was a bit overwhelming for me, as men in Europe tend to be more reserved. I found it challenging sometimes to enjoy simple things like eating alone or spending time at bars because men were so forward. Although this was occasionally frustrating, I appreciated that Nigerians are generally very friendly, and the food I tried was amazing. I especially loved the fruits, they taste so different to fruit in Europe. Even something like a mango in Nigeria tastes vastly different to what I have consumed here in Europe. I did tire of the staples‚Äîswallow, shawarma, and rice seemed to be everywhere‚Äîbut I managed to find some unconventional dishes too. A highlight for me was discovering grilled catfish, which is now my absolute favourite! Another thing I noticed was how prevalent tipping and monetary expectations are. People often expect you to give them money, whether they‚Äôre helping you or not. They won‚Äôt force you, but the persistence can be exhausting. Thankfully, I‚Äôm naturally generous and tend to tip heavily, so I didn‚Äôt mind too much. Plus, seeing the gratitude and smiles from people was rewarding. Throughout my trip, I realised I often received preferential treatment‚Äîsomething I initially resisted acknowledging. For example, I was let through certain situations with ease, while others had a harder time. It was a bit surreal, but I suppose it‚Äôs part of the culture. Despite this, I didn‚Äôt feel unsafe or at risk of being kidnapped or harmed. As with any trip, it‚Äôs important to stay aware of your surroundings and keep your belongings close, but I wouldn‚Äôt say I felt in danger. \*Getting around & currency\* I used Bolt to get around and found it extremely easy to travel around Lagos with this app. While Uber is also available, I preferred Bolt because of the cheaper prices. Compared to euros, the cost of transportation was incredibly affordable, and I didn‚Äôt encounter any issues with taxi drivers. For payments, I used my Revolut card, and the exchange rate was quite favourable. Additionally, I was able to use some apps to transfer money to family members, who helped me get cash when needed. While I didn‚Äôt withdraw money at an ATM myself, I could have easily done so using my Revolut card. \*Passport\* I had arranged to renew my passport while in Nigeria, and one of my uncles helped facilitate the process. This made things much easier for me. I completed my biometric capturing in a single day and received my new passport three days later. If you can arrange this route, I highly recommend it. For context, renewing for a 10-year Nigerian passport in Europe can be expensive and sometimes unavailable due to stock issues. \*My experience departing\* Leaving Nigeria was a much more chaotic experience than arriving. At check-in, the staff were strict about weighing hand luggage. My hand luggage was several kilograms overweight, but the check-in official let me through, saying they liked me (yep, they literally said that lol). While I appreciated getting a pass, I‚Äôd advise others to be careful about packing, as it seems to me they are much stricter with luggage weight when departing Nigeria. In fact the guy in front of me was only over the limit by \~2 kg and they sent him to pay for the excess. Security, however, was the most stressful part of my departure. The personnel at the checkpoints were unprofessional and, frankly, inappropriate. While I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything wrong with a polite compliment, the soldiers at the checkpoint stopped me, asked silly questions, and also tried to flirt. By this point, I was done being polite and felt quietly frustrated. By the time I got to the boarding gate, I was genuinely anxious and just wanted to leave. \*Final thoughts\* Overall, my experience in Nigeria was a solid 8/10. The food, culture, and friendliness of the people made my trip enjoyable. It was also awesome seeing my cousins and also the dude I was talking to. However, the unprofessionalism and unwanted advances I encountered‚Äîparticularly at the airport‚Äîwere a 2/10. If you plan to visit, especially as a solo female traveler, just keep your wits about you and be prepared for some cultural differences. That said, I‚Äôm glad I went. It was a memorable trip, and I‚Äôd love to visit again in the future :) I will definitely be back. I hope this reassures anyone considering travelling solo- it really isn't bad at all! It can be a bit frustrating at times, but for me, the pros far outweighed the cons!",Nigerian

"I Traveled Out of Lagos for the First Time in Years, and I Got a Harsh Reality Check Last week, I traveled to Edo State for a wedding. It was my first time leaving Lagos in a very long time, and I was filled with so much excitement and happiness about the journey. In preparation, I downloaded movies on my phone and even packed my laptop, hoping to work remotely while I was there. However, to my surprise, when I arrived, the internet connection was so poor that I couldn‚Äôt get any work done. To make matters worse, there was no electricity. Thankfully, I was lodged in a hotel, but instead of the usual practice of switching to a generator during power outages, their main source of power was a small generator, limited because of the high cost of fuel. They also had an inverter powered by solar panels as a backup. This meant no air conditioning and no ironing; I had to make do with a fan. It was manageable, but far from what I expected. On the evening of the wedding day, curiosity got the better of me, and I asked why the electricity situation was so bad. I had already spent three days there without power, and it felt strange. To my shock, I was told there hadn't been light in the area for over a month. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. How is that even possible? One of the men I spoke to expressed his frustration, passionately ranting about how poorly electricity is distributed in the area and the many challenges that come with it. He spoke about how it had forced many young people to leave the rural parts of Edo State in search of better opportunities elsewhere. I could feel the pain and helplessness in his voice.

"Rewiring Nigeria: A Reflection on National Purpose and Governance I‚Äôve been thinking‚Ä¶ For a person to truly change, they often need to shift their mindset‚Äîreassess their beliefs, mental models, and the way they see life. Now imagine that on a national scale. Nigeria, like every country, also has a ‚Äúmind.‚Äù And that mind is our governance system‚Äîthe values, decisions, and leadership culture that shape everything else downstream. So I began asking: What would it take to truly rewire Nigeria‚Äôs governance? For me, real change only began when I paused and asked: **""Why am I here?""** That question gave me direction‚Äîand forced me to realign my actions with something deeper. As a country, maybe we need to ask the same: **Why do we exist?** And if we don‚Äôt know‚Äîor can‚Äôt agree‚Äîhow do we know we‚Äôre moving in the right direction? At one point, I was deeply religious. I‚Äôm not as much anymore‚Äîbut since it runs deep in our culture, I‚Äôll share this: **‚ÄúWhere there is no vision, the people perish.‚Äù** ‚Äî Proverbs 29:18 **So I ask again:** What is our shared vision as a nation? Because if we don‚Äôt have one, we‚Äôre just moving in different directions‚Äîeach chasing survival, not progress. And even if we say we have a vision, but don‚Äôt truly invest in it‚Äî Then what‚Äôs the point? Either way, we‚Äôll end up nowhere. So how do we begin to bring every Nigerian under a shared vision‚Äîone that truly benefits all of us? A vision strong enough to shatter tribalism. To uproot corruption.

"üá≥üá¨üá∏üá∑Afro-Diasporian looking for Nigerian Pidgin & Afro Spirituality enthusiasts for linguistic and anthropological research üá∏üá∑Ofa / How far üá≥üá¨ my Naija brethren, I‚Äôm Afro-Surinamese and most of our Ancestors came from Central and West Africa. I‚Äôm doing research about our cultural origins and continuations in the West African region, specifically focusing on Nigeria (Benin, Togo and Ghana) at the moment. ‚Ä¢ Linguistics In the title I mentioned Nigerian Pidgin, because it‚Äôs an English-based Creole language on the continent of Africa closely resembling our English-based Creole in Suriname named ‚ÄúSranantongo, Sranan‚Äù. Sierra Leonean Krio has a very close resemblance to ours as well. The West African influences in our Creole are from Fon, Yoruba, Igbo, Akan (Twi & Fante), Ewe, Mina, Nago, Efik, Ibibio, Mende etc. So if you speak Nigerian Pidgin and/or any of these languages and would like to engage feel free. I‚Äôll show some comparative words and phrases between Sranan and ethnicities relevant to this Reddit to illustrate why I‚Äôm in this Reddit segment for my research. Unu üá∏üá∑ | Una üá≥üá¨ (Igbo) = they, us) | I üá∏üá∑| i, ·ªã üá≥üá¨ (Igbo) = you | Na üá∏üá∑ | Na üá≥üá¨ (Igbo) = locative preposition & highlighter Fukufuku üá∏üá∑ | F√πk√πf√πk√π üá≥üá¨ (Yor) = lungs | Pata üá∏üá∑| B√†t√† üá≥üá¨(Yor) = shoes | Bakba üá∏üá∑| Agbagba üá≥üá¨ (Yor) = plantain | Bakra | mbakara üá≥üá¨ (Efik) = white person | Okro üá∏üá∑| Okworo, okworu, okwuru, okuru üá≥üá¨ = okra Sabi üá∏üá∑ = sabi üá≥üá¨ = to know (Portuguese: saber) Pikin üá∏üá∑ = pikin üá≥üá¨ = child (Portuguese: pequeno) Ofa üá∏üá∑ = How far üá≥üá¨ = what‚Äôs up? | Fa yu de üá∏üá∑ = How you dey üá≥üá¨ = how are you? | Mi de üá∏üá∑ = I dey üá≥üá¨ = I exist (I am fine) | Mi e waka üá∏üá∑= I dey waka = I am walking | Mi no e waka üá∏üá∑ = I no dey waka üá≥üá¨ = I am not walking | Mi o si yu tamara üá∏üá∑ = I go see you tomorrow üá≥üá¨ = I will see you tomorrow Mi sab tak.. üá∏üá∑ = I sabi say.. = I know ‚Äúthat‚Äù.. | Mi no sabi üá∏üá∑ = I no sabi üá≥üá¨ = I don‚Äôt know | Na so üá∏üá∑ = Na so üá≥üá¨ = it is so | Mi begi üá∏üá∑ = Abeg üá≥üá¨ = I beg / please I think y‚Äôall get where I‚Äôm going with this. The similarities between Nigerian Pidgin and Sranan are overwhelmingly clear. ‚Ä¢ Anthropology My Anthropological research is about West and Central African Spirituality. Our Afro-Surinamese Spiritual system is called Winti. It didn‚Äôt syncretize with Christianity and remained fully African leaving us with a large pool of African cultural retention to research. Winti is also the name of our deities. Our equivalent of Vodun and Orishas. I‚Äôll list some of our Winti lexicon that align with Vodun and Orishas below.

Over the past few months, I‚Äôve made some significant improvements to the system, including: * Tone marks for the 10 tones * Vowel length markers * Diphthong and aspiration markers * New glyphs for sounds that weren‚Äôt well represented or weren‚Äôt represented at all, like B, Gb, Th, Dlu, Dlv, X, Die, Dli, Dlo, etc. I‚Äôve got the new glyphs ready in print form, and I‚Äôm currently working on a font that I hope to release in the next few months. This project is really personal for me. Not only do I want to help preserve the Cherokee language, but I also want to be inclusive. As more Cherokee Freedmen reconnect with our African roots‚Äîespecially Yoruba and Igbo‚Äîthere‚Äôs a growing need for a writing system that can reflect that. For example, many of us use the term ‚ÄúObu‚Äù (from Yoruba ‚ÄúOba‚Äù) as a term of endearment, and I want to make sure people can write those connections in the language too. I started this project when I was 10, got serious about it at 18, and now at 26, I‚Äôve put a lot of blood, sweat, and love into this work. Right now, around 100 people (besides myself and the project team) are using the script, and I‚Äôm hoping one day it will be officially adopted by the tribe, or at least recognized. But for now, I just want to get more people using it! I‚Äôm also working on a book that will explain how to use the system, and it will be available for $10. I‚Äôm planning to offer free group lessons and paid individual lessons soon as well. I‚Äôll share the details once everything is sorted out. Thanks so much for letting me share this with you all. I really appreciate the support! ·è©·èô Mo dup·∫π Thank you! (if anyone wants thier name or name of a town etc, written please let me know! :) I will do them as soon as I am able to!

"Vowel deletion in Yor√πb√° Vowel deletion in Yor√πb√°. Hello, B√°wo ni, Hope the learning is going well. Let's discuss Vowel deletion today. It is very common for Yor√πb√° speakers to drop a vowel when they are speaking, especially when they are asking Questions. Most times, you hear K√≠ l√≥r√∫k·ªç ·∫π - - - What is your name? K√≠ l'o f·∫πÃÅ j·∫π - - - - - what do you want to eat? N√≠bo l√≤ w√†. - - - Where are you? N√≠bo l·∫πÃÄ ≈Ñ gb√© - - - Where are you living? Let's expand it. 1. ""K√≠ l'√≥r√∫k·ªç ·∫π"" is"" k√≠ ni or√∫k·ªç ·∫π "" the"" k√≠ ni"" is what 2. K√≠ l'o f·∫πÃÅ j·∫π - - - K√≠ ni o f·∫πÃÅ j·∫π. 3. N√≠bo l√≥ w√†---N√≠bo ni √≥ w√† - - Where is he/she? 4. N√≠bo l·∫πÃÄ ≈Ñ gb√© - - N√≠bo ni ·∫πÃÄ ≈Ñ gb√©. The ""ni"" after the question markers always change to ""L"" when it comes before words that start with vowels O, ·ªå, E, ·∫∏ and A. Hence we have it as K√≠ l'o for K√≠ ni o. When it comes before words that start with Vowel ""I"" or consonant, it doesn't change to ""L"" N√≠bo ni √¨w√© mi w√† - - Where is my book?

"Honorific Pronoun in Yor√πb√° Honorific in Yor√πb√° Hello,. B√°wo ni, Today, let's talk about one of the important thing you need to know if you are learning Yor√πb√°, and that is the use of the Honorific pronoun. Honorific pronouns are respectful pronouns, Yor√πb√° does not indicate gender but we place emphasis on respect and this is where we make use of the Honorific pronoun. This is used when we are speaking to either an older person, plural or in polite conversation or formal conversation with someone. We have four of them 1. ·∫∏ - you (all). It is used with greetings, question markers and it is placed in the subject position, it comes before the verb. 2. Y√çN - YOU. (all). - It is used for possessive, it is placed in the object position after the verb. 3. W·ªçÃÅn (with the high tone ""m√≠""). - He/she/they 4. W·ªçn (with the flat tone ""re""). Him/her/them Let's look at some examples. 1. ·∫∏ k√°√†r·ªçÃÄ - Good morning 2. ·π¢√© ·∫π f·∫πÃÅ j·∫πun - Do you want to eat?. 3. Mo f√∫n y√≠n n√≠ ow√≥ - I gave you money. 4. Mo r√≠ y√≠n l√°n√†√° - I saw you yesterday. 5. W·ªçÃÅn f·∫πÃÅ j·∫πun - He/she wants to eat. 6. Mo f√∫n w·ªçn n√≠ b√†t√† - - I gave him shoe.

"Greetings in Yor√πb√° Greetings is one of the most important aspect of Yor√πb√° culture. I know you are familiar with ""·∫∏ k√°√†√°r·ªçÃÄ, ·∫∏ k√°s√†n and other basic greetings, but do you know how to express the greetings conversation fully. Greetings is conversational, you ought to also respond to the greetings. In Yor√πb√°, we have some basic words we use for greetings like"" ·∫∏ k√∫u, k√∫, ·π£√©, b√°wo, ≈Ñk·ªçÃÅ. Let's analyze them. 1. ·∫∏ K√öU /K√ö. ""·∫∏ k√∫u"" is used to greet someone older, group of people and sign of respect even while greeting someone's age of group. This is what is used for most of the greetings. We can use ""·∫∏ kaa with"" √†√°r·ªçÃÄ (morning) , ·ªçÃÄs√°n (afternoon) , √†b·ªçÃÄ (return). Example. A. ·∫∏ k√∫u i·π£·∫πÃÅ - - - - - - Well done. B. ·∫∏ k√∫u or√≠ire - - - - congratulations. C. K√∫ ·ªçj·ªçÃÅ m·∫πÃÅta - - - - This is used to greet someone you have not seen in a while. 2. ·π¢√â This could mean hope you , have you, will you depending on the content. But in greeting context, it mean ""hope you are"" Example. 1. ·π¢√© d√°ad√°a ni--------hope you are fine Response: d√°ad√°a ni/√†l√†√°f√≠√† ni---I am fine or at peace. 2. ·π¢√© d√°ad√°a lo w√† - - - still hope you are fine. Response :d√°ad√°a n√≠ mo w√†. - - I am fine. To an older person you would say. ·π¢√© d√°ad√°a l·∫π w√†. 3. B√ÅWO This is ""how"" in Yor√πb√° and it is also used for greeting. Example. 1. B√°wo ni - - - - How are you. 2. B√°wo ni n«πkan - - - How are things. 3. B√°wo ni il√© - - - - - - - - How is family. 4. B√°wo ni i·π£·∫πÃÅ - - - - - - How is work.

"Seeking help in translating Igbo phrases Hi everyone, I need some help in translating a few phrases/sentences from Igbo into English. I'm writing MA thesis on the Polish translation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's ""Americanah"" and for the sake of data analysis I need to know the meaning of some Igbo excerpts that appear in the novel. I've done as much online research as I could but still there are some Igbo insertions I wasn't able to translate myself. Unfortunately, I don't know this language, so I would be truly grateful for any help from you. These are the Igbo parts the English meaning of which I want to ask you about: 1. ***kwa*** - this word appears several times throughout the novel in contexts like: ""Normal ***kwa***? It's not normal at all"" or ""Ugly, ***kwa***? What are you talking about?""; I assume this word is used to express disagreement or surprise, it that right? 2. ***o rika*** - this phrase appeared in the sentence: ""Thirty-five is too much, ***o rika***, biko"" 3. **rapuba** - as in a sentence: ""It will happen for you, don't worry, **rapuba**"" 4. ***shay*** - this one possibly comes from Nigerian Pidgin but, of course, correct me if I'm wrong; it was used in this context: ""Ifemelu did not have the heart to tell her that nobody said ""**shay**"" any more"" and from this I gathered that shay is a word popular among teenagers in Nigeria that after all became obsolete 5. ***sah*** - as in: ""I hope everything is fine, ***sah***"" And a few longer excerpts: 1. ***I maka.*** - (""You put on some weight and it suits you. ***I maka***."") 2. ***Ife esika kita***. - (""***Ife esika kita.*** The recession is biting everybody."") 3. ***I ga-askiwa***. - (""(‚Ä¶) but you Igbo people? ***I ga-askiwa.***"") 4. ***Aru adikwa***? - (""***Aru adikwa?***"" Obinze shrugged. ""I'm fine. Just tired."") 5. ***ma ife*** - (""Obinze ***ma ife***."" - here Obinze is the name of the protagonist) 6. ***Nwanyi oma, nwoke oma, omalicha nwa, ezigbo oyi m o.*** If any of you could provide me with an explanation of any of these words/phrases, I would appreciate it very much.

"J K Rowling new fund, to waste Scottish tax payers money. So J.K. Rowling has set up the ‚ÄúJ.K. Rowling Women‚Äôs Fund‚Äù (JKRWF). She‚Äôs not accepting donations, because she‚Äôs bankrolling it herself. On the surface, it claims to protect ‚Äúsex-based rights,‚Äù but when you dig in, it‚Äôs very clearly about one thing: funding legal action to exclude trans women from public life especially places like schools, the NHS, and prisons. And guess who pays for all the fallout from that? Us, The Scottish taxpayer. The real cost of her court cases will be the Scottish tax payier. Her fund supports lawsuits and tribunal cases against public services places run with your tax money. Schools, hospitals, councils, women‚Äôs shelters, the police. Every time one of her cases goes to court, these institutions have to spend your money to defend themselves. If they lose, they pay damages and legal fees. If they win, they still burn through cash and time that should be going to actual services. She spends a few grand? We end up footing a bill in the hundreds of thousands. These lawsuits aren‚Äôt about protecting anyone. They‚Äôre about forcing public services to change policies that include trans people. That means expensive overhauls of staff training, signage, protocols more money wasted to appease a personal vendetta. And all while the NHS is on its knees, schools are underfunded, and councils are going bankrupt. But instead, she chose to create a legal fund targeting one of the most marginalised groups in society. Trans people especially trans women ,are already at greater risk of homelessness, violence, and suicide. This fund makes all of that worse. Nobody voted for this. It‚Äôs not protecting women, it‚Äôs fuelling a media-frenzied culture war that‚Äôs actively harming people. And it's being done with the resources of the public sector tied up in expensive court cases. J.K. Rowling is not being silenced. She‚Äôs using her wealth to bully trans people through the legal system, and the Scottish public is paying the price.",Scottish

"Why are there so many non-Scottish voices in spoken Scottish media? We have a wealth of diversity within Scotland, with people from every possible social and ethnic group, all with one of the many different types of Scottish accents and languages. Our English language media is massively dominated with English, American, and other non-Scottish voices. I'm glad all that is available to us, it allows us to see the similarities across, and the diversity of, the English speaking world. Scotland has a comparatively tiny media, disproportionately small compared with other nations of 5.5 million people. And it's great to welcome those people who grew up outwith Scotland who have chosen to make it their home. But Scottish produced media quite obviously has a massive over representation of voices that are not from Scotland. Do you think it's because we collectively hate the sounds of our own voices?

"Cammanachd - Have you played? Hello! While I'm not Scottish, as I don't live there, contribute to the economy, or vote in Scotland or the UK, I have a deep appreciation for your country and a genuine curiosity about its cultures, particularly right now regarding the sport of camanachd. I‚Äôm interested in exploring the prevalence of this sport below the Highland Line. Is camanachd taught and played in schools in those areas below the line? Have you played? What was your experience like? Additionally, I'm curious about the accessibility of the sport. How easy is it to find pick-up games or community events for those interested in playing in urban areas? For individuals who are passionate about camanachd, how inclusive is the community for players below the Highland Line? I think camanachd is a thrilling game to watch, and it seems equally exciting to play. Documentaries have highlighted its significance in the Highlands and Islands, showcasing how it fosters extremely deep community bonds and camaraderie among participants and fans. It appears to serve as a positive outlet for youth and adults, offering an alternative to challenges such as alcoholism, substance abuse and mental health struggles, which can be prevalent in some highland areas. I'm also pondering whether the lack of abundant positive opportunities for youth in the Highlands has contributed to camanachd becoming a central element of community life, or if it always has been. Furthermore, in regions where camanachd may not be as prevalent, does football fill that role instead? I would love and appreciate to hear more about the community dynamics, the growth of camanachd in various regions to the south, and how it compares to other sports in terms of engagement and support.

"Is anyone worried about the trouble these browns are causing? So I try to be a fair and reasonable person, but I live near these people, and I swear every week I'm reading something in the newpaper about all the troubles they're causing. First off, they just seem to keep pumping out kids. The eldest is about 30, and the youngest seems to be about 4. I think they have about 8 kids in total, and it seems like at some point they gave up even naming their own kids, calling them ""the twins"" and ""the bairn"". I feel sorry for the poor mother, I dont know how she can keep doing this at her age. They all live in the same house, with the exception of their grandfather. I've passed by a few times, and the noise they create is diabolical. I heard them the other day arguing about playing Jimmy Shand on a gramophone. Who even has a gramophone in this day and age? The eldest children seem to spend half their lives on the pull, and I don't think I've ever seen one come back with the same partner twice. While I don't want to shame anyone for their lifestyle choices, I wonder what makes them so unlikeable theyre incapable of getting a second date? I don't think a single one of them is in full time employment. They're happy to keep having children, and the whole lot seem like a bunch of benefit scroungers. Honestly, its making me think about leaving Glebe Street. I guess it could be worse though, my uncle works for the police, and he's constantly being terrorised by a gang of youths led by a lad in dungarees.",Scottish

"Shared Boundary Fence - Troubles with Neighbour Hello! Seeking some (potential) legal advice/understanding. On the deeds to our land it states that the boundary fence between ours and the neighbours is mutually owned, with maintenance to be carried out by both parties. (From my understanding, common in Scots Law). The owners of the house don‚Äôt live there, they instead rent it out to tenants. During the big storms in February the fence slats (not the posts) had came down, and we had repaired the fence and ensured it was still standing. The fence generally was in quite a poor state of disrepair, we have only owned the property for two years, and it was/has been in this state since we took ownership. The only maintenance the owners of the adjacent land claim to undertake is painting it on their side (we‚Äôve never seen them at the house before). The tenants over the last month/months had moved out, and we have seen essentially nobody coming and going to the property during this time. We had plans to remove the fence and replace it with a fence which was more sturdy, in better condition, and taller (still under the 2m height). Because the house had sat empty for a number of weeks we took the decision to take down the fence slats and put up a new fence. We haven‚Äôt removed the existing posts, and instead the new posts were fixed more clearly in our side of the boundary line - this was not for any intention other than avoiding tree roots which had taken root and made putting posts in on the actual boundary line very difficult. So the boundary/shared fence still has posts, and the new posts are firmly in our land. The slats were completely and utterly rotten, poorly maintained, and crumbling apart - there was no possible way they could be salvaged. We would have liked the chance to let them know of our plans, but with no way to get in contact with them, and the fear of the fence potentially coming down again and injuring our dog, we took the decision to just do the upgrade. We mistakenly thought they‚Äôd appreciate a new, higher quality fence that they didn‚Äôt have to pay a penny for. They‚Äôve shown up recently to do garden maintenance for their next tenant to take the lease, and have taken umbrage against us for having taken down the shared fence and are threatening that we return it (impossible due to the condition) or build a new shared fence on the boundary line. Are we in hot water here?",Scottish

"Private health ins for kids with autism? I‚Äôm doing a bit of legwork on behalf of a friend with limited English. Long story short he has a 3 year old son who is likely to be diagnosed with fairly severe autism (once he can get in to see a specialist). I understand most preexisting conditions require a 12 month waiting period and thats fine, but I‚Äôm having trouble identifying policies that cover things like speech therapy and other development related Family has a fair number of other ongoing medical issues, so good private coverage is probably best in any event (even though they are well below the levy threshold) as public appointments are rare as hen‚Äôs teeth where we are. Does anyone have experience and have recommendations for solid private coverage, with an emphasis on the aspects mentioned above? Thank you! Edit: i should mention that he‚Äôs also pursuing ndis as well, but what a fucking labyrinth that is. It‚Äôs hard to keep everything straight as he‚Äôs been sent to so many places but the latest word is that the only places he can get in to get ndis diagnosis in a relatively short period of time are gojng to be private. He will do what he must to pay for it in the short term, but as his son will likely require long term treatment, i was thinking private insurance might‚Äîin this instance‚Äîpay off. He does have centrelink cards, etc. If that changes anything. EDIT EDIT: dear all, thank you SO MUCH for the advice and insight. I really appreciate it. I will be meeting my friend tomorrow and will be making some phone calls. We‚Äôve been in touch with so many different people and they keep saying we need a diagnosis before they can act, so this has been very, very helpful. Negative knowledge (i.e., private health insurance is not a good option for this) is also very useful. Let‚Äôs me focus on more productive avenues. Thanks again, i‚Äôm quite moved by all the helpful info. Edit edit edit: ok I‚Äôve received some more emails from my friend. Someone from EACH came to his house last week and sent a followup email. They said: **‚ÄùIf you are worried about [son] being on the autism spectrum you can have him assessed by a Paediatrician. You can be referred to a paediatrician by your GP and there is the public paediatricians but the wait time to see them is quite long or you are able to go privately but there is a cost you will have to pay for this. ‚Äú** Also: **‚ÄùHere are 2 speech therapists that have said they have possible space to take on new children, they are private so there will be a cost involved‚Äù** So i‚Äôm confused. What does EACH do besides send us to private practices with no financial support? i‚Äôll call tomorrow for clarification, but for the most part their advice has simply been to go pay a paediatrician and go pay for speech therapy. I mean, yeah, ok, but is that really the extent of their assistance? Oh and they had some basic advice on how to encourage him to speak (he‚Äôs nonverbal) and sent a link to a playgroup website‚Ä¶.

"Why are hospitality venue owners so stubborn/small/backwards/stuck in the past thinking? I recently completed a 3 night trial at a venue in a capital city. During the interview I was told ¬∑ the venue was 4 stories high (3 active floors and a basement used for private functions, weeknights and spillover) ¬∑ That ownership has 4 venues ¬∑ It‚Äôs a party (owners favourite word) venue ¬∑ The management structure is venue manager, assistant venue manager, supervisors (up to 4) ¬∑ Management (all levels) should be on the floor as much as possible and rarely in the office ¬∑ Ownership has been collecting data on patronage, volume of sales, volume of drinks per patron etc and developed KPIs to match for each night ¬∑ A whiskey bar with over 30 whiskeys and other spirits (advertised on website) When in reality ¬∑ The venue is currently only operating the basement room (which is a dark, dingy, dungeon like space without any of the cool dungeon appeal) ¬∑ Its actually 2 venues ¬∑ The atmosphere does not lend itself to ‚Äòparty‚Äô ¬∑ There is no assistant venue manager, just VM and the sole supervisor role I am doing a trial for ¬∑ The VM spends half of the night in the office uploading data into the system for ownership to keep track of ‚Äì including how many promo cards are handing out on the street vs handed in at the door for discounted entry (which is fine) ‚Äì but to be physically uploaded as data into the system every hour ¬∑ The KPIs are measured down the person per hour as expectations (in attendance and then spending volume) ‚Äì the VM seemed under immense stress to hit ‚Äòtargets/projections‚Äô (not enough people coming through the door was apparently the fault of the promo people in the street, once inside not enough spend per patron was management and bars fault) ¬∑ Bar staff are encouraged to try upsell patrons drink order towards a more expensive drink (I believe you do that maybe once on their first drink, but as a bartender you get what someone wants, you do not tell them what they want) ‚Äì also to move patrons on from beer to spirits as soon as possible as the profit margin is higher and also alcohol to get them to spend more money ¬∑ Was told point blank by manager of other venue while discussing ideas to improve business that ‚Äòyou keep them to yourself for at least 6 months, ownership doesn‚Äôt want to hear it‚Äô ¬∑ Whiskey bar is part of the venue not being used ‚Äì but none of the drinks made their way down to the 1 bar still in use ¬∑ There is no active social media ¬∑ And the bit that got me undone ‚Äì health and safety out the window ‚Äì I had to mop up a scene after a guy in a wheelchair was forced to urinate on the floor in the space before the toilets because there was no ramp to allow wheelchair access over the 3 stairs (heritage listed buildings don‚Äôt have to comply with disability access, but no access to toilets is a step to far for me that is discrimination) ‚Äì but no wet floor signs, no gloves the next night for a staff member to clean up spew in a basin, no rubber mats on the floor behind the bar, rips in the carpet that catch shoes and the feet of barstools, steps that are unlit and trip hazards) and staff and patrons openly vaping in the venue despite it being completely against the law - and me being the arsehole for telling people to stop it. At the end of the trial (so around 4am on the Sunday morning) I was offered the supervisor role by the VM but expressed concerns regarding the operations of the business and particularly the lack of health and safety practices, and said I had to think about it, but would be likely back as I feel I can make a difference. I received a phone call around 6pm that Sunday night telling me I was not required as there were ‚Äòother trials‚Äô being conducted. I texted the General Manager (who had been my contact) asking if matter could be discussed, the reply was ‚ÄòYou are not the right fit‚Äô and they are currently readvertising. Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt the first venue I have been at where ownership seems to only care about their own profit regardless of anything else (and if business isn‚Äôt doing well then cut corners and blame staff) and their own ego (and definitely not being challenged). I might be a bit old school ‚Äì but I believe that profits will come if you earn them ‚Äì ie, good product, good service, happy customers, good advertising (which is basically free in a social media age, if you do it), reputations (this venues one is down the drain I was told on the street) and the ability to keep staff instead of advertising constantly. It shouldn't feel like an episode of Kitchen Nightmares with Gordon Ramsay where everyone, but the owner knows what is wrong with the business and generally agrees how to improve it (and wants too), but ownership refuses to change and just blames the staff and customers. But, I guess that is why I am not an owner.. or in this case a supervisor any more either - have a feeling I am not the only hospo worker in the same situation",Australian

"Anti-First Amendment Bill on the floor today? I‚Äôm seeing that , the bill by Senator Creighton and Rep. Leach, is up on the House floor today.

Our ministry brings pastors and faith leaders to campus to speak in the free speech zones. It‚Äôs a big part of how we share the Gospel and build community. From what I‚Äôm reading, this bill would make that a lot harder maybe even impossible. It also bans expressive activity between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. So does that mean no more Midnight Yell at A&M? That‚Äôs a Texas tradition. And what about tailgates? We use tents, we play music, we gather in those same spaces. The language in this bill is so broad, it sounds like that could be at risk too. It just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me.

"From Lubbock to Houston: A Texan‚Äôs Defense of the Global University I was born and educated in Texas. I studied in Lubbock, I live in College Station, and I receive neurological care at UTHealth in Houston. That triangle alone‚ÄîTexas Tech, Texas A&M, and UTHealth‚Äîrepresents thousands of international students, scholars, and doctors who didn‚Äôt just choose to come here. They \*were invited.\* Now the federal government is aiming political weapons at them. And they‚Äôre pretending it won‚Äôt hit the rest of us. They‚Äôre wrong. Recently, the Department of Homeland Security launched a direct assault on Harvard University‚Äôs ability to enroll international students. It‚Äôs a stunt. A pellet gun aimed at a buck so big it won‚Äôt fall‚Äîbut loud enough to scatter the herd. And make no mistake: I \*am\* in that herd. Because when you fire at Harvard, you don‚Äôt just target the Ivy League. You spook the institutions that hold Texas together. You disrupt our universities, our clinics, our labs, and our futures. *The Doctor Who Keeps Me Alive* At UTHealth, my neurologist‚Äîlike many others‚Äîwas born overseas. He came here to learn, to teach, and to treat patients like me. My ability to write this right now is partially thanks to the very kind of visa-holder that DHS is quietly threatening. You think these policies just affect elite students in Cambridge? They affect my seizure care in Houston. They affect the research being done in Lubbock. They affect who teaches your niece chemical engineering in College Station. You don‚Äôt get to separate Harvard from Texas when international education is the \*bridge\* between them. *Texas Tech Taught Me That Diversity Isn‚Äôt Cosmetic* When I was a student at Texas Tech, I saw firsthand the power of a diverse faculty and student body. It wasn‚Äôt political. It was \*effective.\* I learned from professors from India, Egypt, Korea, Nigeria, and Brazil. I worked on projects with students from Uzbekistan and Colombia. We didn‚Äôt sit around singing Kumbaya. We solved problems. We debated ideas. We competed and collaborated and made each other sharper. That‚Äôs the global university. Not a ‚Äúwoke‚Äù fantasy. A working engine. And now, the same federal officials who claim to champion innovation want to strip that engine for parts‚Äîbecause they don‚Äôt like what a few students believe? Because they think fear will keep us safe? *This Is About Control, Not Security* Let‚Äôs not be coy. This isn‚Äôt about national security. It‚Äôs about narrative control. It‚Äôs about telling public universities, ‚ÄúYou can have federal funding, but only if you help us police your students.‚Äù It‚Äôs about turning faculty into informants. About chilling research. About reminding anyone with a visa that their presence is conditional‚Äîfragile, revocable, and watched. But if public universities comply with this logic, they will cease to be public in any meaningful way. They‚Äôll become gatekeepers of obedience, not gateways to knowledge. *We Don‚Äôt Scatter. We Turn.* This is not a time to stay quiet, and it‚Äôs not a time to pretend this only affects the coasts. If Texas A&M, Texas Tech, UTHealth‚Äîand institutions like them‚Äîstand together, then the herd won‚Äôt scatter. It will \*pivot.\* And when it does, the people lighting firecrackers in D.C. will realize they were never holding a gun. They were just holding a match in a dry season. If you're reading this and thinking, ‚ÄúThis doesn‚Äôt concern me,‚Äù think again. If you live in Texas and you‚Äôve ever been treated in a hospital, driven through a college town, or sent a kid to a public university‚Äîthen this isn‚Äôt about someone else. It‚Äôs about you.

It really sucks feeling like you're different all the time when your most ""radical"" positions are: guns are a public health issue, poor people should get healthcare regardless of job status, and pregnancy is hard on a woman's body and she shouldn't be forced to carry a fetus to term. Honestly, other than that, I'd probably be a moderate by Minnesota standards--I went to a very PC liberal arts college, and that shit made me a bit more right-wing. It just sucks living here (DFW area) because you believe in pronouncing Kamala Harris's name right, you don't think socialist sympathizers are the causes of the world's ills, you think atheists are fine people, and you don't believe dogs can prevent school shootings (real conversations I have had with people here). Obviously, Dallas voted blue, so it's not like everyone here thinks that way, but it gets very frustrating. So convince me not to flee--I'd only be making $40k a year as a medical assistant, so it's not like I could live a grand lifestyle there. Edit: Thanks for all the support (even though that's not ostensibly what I wanted? Lol)! Strangely enough (maybe because of emphasis on medical and UNIONS), wages are $2-3 an hour greater there. The reason I chose Minneapolis over, say, somewhere in the Pacific Northwest is because cost of living (or at least rent, maybe not gas & groceries) is actually lower than in DFW.

"Texas AG Ken Paxton Can Access Your Prescription Records >PDMP datasets typically include patient details, medication dosages, refill schedules, and identifying information for the prescriber and pharmacy. In nine states, the PDMP entry even contains the diagnosis code (ICD-10) associated with the prescription. That means a police officer scrutinizing the file could directly see why a person was prescribed a drug. In states like Tennessee or Florida, which track diagnoses, a record showing testosterone cypionate accompanied by an ICD code for ‚Äúgender dysphoria‚Äù would immediately telegraph that the patient is transgender. >As is often the case with law enforcement surveillance tools, PDMPs have proven susceptible to mission creep, Oliva writes, noting that most state programs now track not only opioids but ‚Äúall controlled substances as well as non-controlled ‚Äòdrugs of concern.‚Äô‚Äù In other words, a system built to catch illicit OxyContin refills has quietly become a mechanism to monitor any number of treatments ‚Äì from anxiety medications and stimulants for the treatment of ADHD to testosterone for gender transition. >Crucially, this vast trove of prescription records exists in a legal gray zone outside standard medical privacy protections. The questions about HIPAA compliance typically come up when I've discussed this subject. However, once a pharmacy uploads your data to a PDMP, that information is no longer covered by HIPAA privacy rules. Instead, each state dictates who can access the PDMP and for what purpose. Unfortunately, law enforcement agencies have lobbied hard for access. >Today, every state allows police or prosecutors to retrieve PDMP data, often without so much as a warrant. In many jurisdictions, all it takes is an administrative request or subpoena to sift through a person‚Äôs prescription history. Some PDMPs even generate unsolicited alerts such as if the software‚Äôs algorithms deem someone‚Äôs prescribing or usage ‚Äúsuspicious,‚Äù it can automatically tip off law enforcement. [...] >In their quest to create a gender bureaucracy to police the lives of transgender people, the anti-trans side is on board with the creation of an Orwellian surveillance state that tracks everyone's prescriptions. >Given how much more prevalent hormone prescriptions are among the cisgender population, any attempt to police and surveil transgender people's prescriptions will inevitably catch orders of magnitude more cis people in the surveillance dragnet. But that's entirely the intention. In this situation, it's become explicitly clear that transgender people are a mere pretext to enable a mass surveillance system to gain control over everyone's bodies and what prescriptions they are able to take.

"No Shelter, No Humane Officer‚ÄîDogs in Lincoln County, WV I want to bring attention to something deeply troubling happening in Lincoln County, West Virginia‚Äîa place that has no county-run animal shelter and no humane officer. That means when dogs are neglected, abused, or abandoned, there‚Äôs no official system to help them. Instead, a few small nonprofit rescues‚Äîrun by caring, overwhelmed individuals‚Äîare doing all the work. They‚Äôre trying to save dogs that are starving, tied up in raw sewage, or exposed to the elements, and they‚Äôre doing it with little support and no authority. To make matters worse, reports to the Lincoln County Sheriff‚Äôs Department often go unanswered, and in many cases, there are serious concerns about how complaints are handled‚Äîor ignored altogether. People have documented the failure to act on cruelty cases, misinformation being spread, and neglect of public health issues. Some even suspect systemic corruption. I‚Äôve started a project to share these dogs‚Äô stories and photos to help them get visibility and maybe find homes, but this isn‚Äôt just an animal welfare issue‚Äîit‚Äôs about justice, public health, and accountability in our rural communities. If you believe in animal welfare, government transparency, or just doing what‚Äôs right, please share this. We need pressure, eyes, and support to protect the voiceless in places like Lincoln County. Thank you.",Southern US
"Turns to you Appalachia, stoic, old, and deep, Where shadows lengthen as the sunbeams creep Through ancient forests, hemlock, pine, and oak, And silence settles, save for crow's harsh croak. I've walked your paths, where laurel thickets bind, A solitary journey, peace to find. Your granite bones, unyielding to the frost, Hold tales of lives, both lived and truly lost. A Shiver in the Pines Yet sometimes, in the hollows, still and gray, A chilling quiet steals the breath away. A sudden gust, where no wind ought to be, Stirs phantom leaves upon a ghostly tree. The whispers travel on the mountain air, Of old, forgotten things, beyond compare To the mortal senses, a flicker in the eye, A sense of someone watching, passing by. The mists that cling, a comfort and a shroud, Obscuring peaks that pierce the passing cloud, They whisper secrets to the listening ear, Of time unhurried, banishing all fear. No grand display, no sharp, dramatic peak, But rolling grandeur, humble, strong, and meek. A steadfast presence, comforting and true, My heart, old mountains, ever turns to you.",Southern US
"Endurance A hushed rumble, then a groan, The Earth itself, a battle zone. Two giants rose in ancient days, To stake their claim, in mountain ways. The Rockies, sharp with icy breath, Spoke first, of power, and of death: ""I pierce the sky, my peaks so grand, The youngest, strongest, in the land! With granite might, I touch the stars, Bearing scars of primal wars. My snow-capped crowns, they gleam and shine, A testament to power divine. Rivers rush from my high embrace, I carve the canyons, set the pace Bow down now and pass the crown!"" The Appalachians, soft and low, Replied with wisdom, alm and slow: ""Young upstart, boasting of height, You know not age, nor weathered light. I‚Äôve seen eons, watched them turn, Felt glaciers grind, and forests burn. My rounded shoulders, green and deep, Hold secrets while the young ones sleep. For I have stood, through ages vast, Where sharper peaks could never last. My ancient roots, they hold the ground, Where life in countless forms is found. Though gentle now, my spirit‚Äôs keen, A tapestry of evergreen. You boast of youth, and sudden rise, But I have witnessed timeless skies. Your jagged edges, they will wear, While I endure, beyond compare. For strength is not in height alone, But in the long-held, solid stone. I am the bedrock, old and true, And I, young friend, Will outlast you."" A silence fell, the wind did sigh, As clouds moved slowly through the sky. The Rockies, for a moment, bowed, Their youthful boasts, now unavowed. For in the whispers of the breeze, And rustling leaves among the trees, The ancient truth began to gleam: Endurance conquers everything.",Southern US

"Why don't anyone ask these people why they continue to vote for Republicans? Republicans have made theses states poorer, sicker, and more illiterate/uneducated. States such as West Virginia, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Tennessee have consistently supported Republican candidates at both the state and federal levels. Despite ongoing struggles with poverty, limited access to healthcare, and challenges in education systems, the political loyalty in these regions remains largely unchanged. Why is there so little national discussion or inquiry into the reasons behind this enduring support?",Southern US
"Rules of the mountain If you hike where the fog clings low to the pine, And the wind through the holler hums mournful in time, Then heed what the old ones have carved into lore, Or you won‚Äôt leave the woods like you‚Äôve left them before. When daylight is dying, be back in your bed, For the dusk wakes the ones that remember the dead. Don‚Äôt open for knocking, don‚Äôt answer your name, If it stands on two legs but don‚Äôt move the same. If you hear a soft song where no singer should be, Keep walking and humming, eyes down, don‚Äôt you dare see. Leave bread on the stump if you‚Äôve borrowed the trail, Or the Little Ones curse you with more than just ail. Don‚Äôt wave at the figure who waits in the field, It knows you‚Äôve now seen it and won‚Äôt stay concealed. Don‚Äôt speak of the thing that you glimpsed in the trees, What‚Äôs named becomes real, and it‚Äôll find you with ease. If silence falls sudden, then hush every breath, For the quiet in woods is the herald of death. Three pennies at crossroads, don‚Äôt ask, just obey, Or you‚Äôll owe a fare that you can‚Äôt ever pay. Don‚Äôt cut at the oak with a face in the bark, Its roots run through bones buried deep in the dark. If a man joins your fire and don‚Äôt meet your gaze, Offer food, speak no questions, and part ways with praise. Don‚Äôt fish past the hour when the moon‚Äôs at its height, What bites past that mark drags you down out of sight. Mark ash on your door come the coldest of nights, To ward off the shadows that dance without light. If you wake up with dirt on the soles of your feet, Say thanks and lie down, don‚Äôt recall, don‚Äôt repeat. And pray, not the way that the preacher man said, But the tongue of your grandma, who speaks to the dead.",Southern US

"Appalachian Outlaw In-between hills, where shadows softly creep, Where the law‚Äôs thin hand could barely keep, We did what we must, with hearts both bold and deep, Just to keep our hungry kin from silent weep. They talk now loud, but their knowing is asleep, unaware of all the secrets mountains keep. I used to run shine where the wild winds blow, Through the mountain pass, with a fiery glow, Boot on the gas, pushing hard and low, Law on my back, a hunter I outgrow. Copper stills hiss, a whispered, heated show, Mama prayed hard, for the seeds we‚Äôd sow. Taught by my old man, whose heart held ember's heat, Taught me the craft, said ""never retreat."" Scars on my hands, a story incomplete. Fed dogs bark, a sound that can‚Äôt defeat, I walk right past, on silent, knowing feet. In these parts, where loyalties run neat, I‚Äôm like a blade of grass, in fields of summer wheat. Took my lumps hard, But my spirit stayed complete. Even when they came, with badges sharp and neat, I never cracked, just vanished in the lush green. Took my time, till setting of the sun, Never said a thing, till the hard-won race was run. Pour one out slow, For the ones who faught hard, 'til life‚Äôs thread was spun, Outlaws never fold but we carry heavy hearts when all is said and done. They called me criminal, with voices sharp and mean, Said I‚Äôd surely burn, in fires yet unseen. But the judge don‚Äôt know, how the cold nights intervene, When your kin got mouths, and your gut feels gaunt and lean. You do what you must, a path you must convene, Don‚Äôt care what it takes, though the consequences mean. If I fall, bury me, where mossy stones convene, Down by the creek, where the water flows serene. Seen more war in these woods, than their sheltered City eyes have gleaned, I lost blood and good friends, to the lead that intervened. Some to the feds, their wicked plots well-screened, Some to the way of life, a bitter fate uncleaned. But I never did fold, my purpose ever keen, Never lost my nerve, In any harsh ravine. I'm no saint, that much is plain to see, Never claimed that crown, for a sinner such as me. Never backed down, when trouble came so free, Put my truth in the jar, for all the world to heed. My son, the next young soul, beneath the old oak tree, Taught the family code, for all eternity. So if they speak of me, let their voices all agree, I was ten toes deep in mountain smoke, wild and free. my legend walks, where the honeysuckle clings, Through every trail and song the robin sings. Kept my kin fed, when the dinner bell would ring, And I fought the law, Buried many badges deep, And I Dug my own, when my end was soon to be, A life lived hard, in this Appalachian outlaw scene.",Southern US

The more I research, the more I realize how many of our traditions and ways of life are deeply Appalachian. I‚Äôve always felt something click when I visit places like Scioto County or parts of WV and Ky, like a breath of fresh air, like I‚Äôm home. That said, I want to be respectful.

"I posted this on tiktok and made a lot of folks mad I'm angry and sad about the entire situation. So many lives lost that could have been prevented. I know, in a perfect world my state wouldn't have voted this way. But I think there is a certain nuance to situations like these that folks who don't live in Appalachia don't understand. I think it comes with so much prejudice towards poor folks that has been hammered into Americans for so long. Folks don't want to acknowledge that there's a system in place keeping the poor down. Keeping education, healthcare, and basic necessities a luxury, so that they keep voting against their own interests. I don't think these folks can comprehend a life where you have to chose between working as a kid to provide for your siblings or going to school. I don't think they can comprehend what it might be like to not be able to read or write as an adult. Kentucky has 37.5% of adults reading between a 3rd and 8th grade level. I don't think they can comprehend that some folks don't even have access to reliable Internet. I see folks making comparison to the LA wildfires and saying they are just ""giving it back"" because folks were saying it was God's judgement to California. That shit wasn't right in the slightest, but you know what the difference is? A lot of folks in LA are wealthy and have somewhere to go. We heard about it for months. There were fundraisers hosted by the NFL and celebrities, but this will be lost in the news cycle within the next couple of days. I see a lot of similarities between this and hurricane Katrina. A lot of those victims were simply forgotten and blamed because they were poor and lived in a red state. But they didn't deserve it. They didn't vote for that. Sorry for the long rant but I long for the day when folks can see Appalachia for the beautiful and complex place that it is, instead of using it as a scapegoat to ignore their own prejudice and hate towards the less fortunate and disenfranchised. I know there are many hateful Appalachians but like everywhere in the world the good folks always outweigh the bad. The revolution is going to have folks from all walks of life.
